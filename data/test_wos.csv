"Accurate predictions of fluid properties, such as density, oil formation volume factor and bubble point pressure, are essentials for all reservoir engineering calculations. In this paper, an approach based on nonlinear system identification modeling; Nonlinear ARX (NARX) and Hammerstein-Wiener (HW) predictive model, is proposed for forecasting the pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) properties of crude oil systems. To this end, two datasets; one containing 168 PVT samples from different Iranian oil reservoirs and other a databank containing 755 data from various geographical locations, were employed to construct (i.e. train) and evaluate (i.e. test) the models. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NARX and HW models outperform previously employed methods including three types of artificial neural networks models (committee machine, multilayer perceptron and radial basis function), two types of ANFIS models (grid partition and fuzzy c-mean) and several empirical correlations with the smallest prediction error, and that they are reliable models for predicting the oil properties in reservoirs engineering among other soft computing approaches.

"Aim: RhoA/Rho-associated kinase and arginase are implicated in vascular complications in diabetes. This study investigated whether RhoA/Rho-associated kinase and arginase inhibition protect from myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury in type 1 diabetes and the mechanisms behind these effects. Methods: Rats with streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes and non-diabetic rats were subjected to 30min myocardial ischaemia and 2h reperfusion after being randomized to treatment with (1) saline, (2) RhoA/Rho-associated kinase inhibitor hydroxyfasudil, (3) nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N-G-monomethyl-l-arginine monoacetate followed by hydroxyfasudil, (4) arginase inhibitor N-omega-hydroxy-nor-l-arginine, (5) N-G-monomethyl-l-arginine monoacetate followed by N-omega-hydroxy-nor-l-arginine or (6) N-G-monomethyl-l-arginine monoacetate given intravenous before ischaemia. Results: Myocardial arginase activity, arginase 2 expression and RhoA/Rho-associated kinase activity were increased in type 1 diabetes (p<0.05). RhoA/Rho-associated kinase inhibition and arginase inhibition significantly reduced infarct size in diabetic and non-diabetic rats (p<0.001). The cardioprotective effects of hydroxyfasudil and N-omega-hydroxy-nor-l-arginine in diabetes were abolished by nitric oxide synthase inhibition. RhoA/Rho-associated kinase inhibition attenuated myocardial arginase activity in diabetic rats via a nitric oxide synthase-dependent mechanism. Conclusion: Inhibition of either RhoA/Rho-associated kinase or arginase protects from ischaemia-reperfusion injury in rats with type 1 diabetes via a nitric oxide synthase-dependent pathway. These results suggest that inhibition of RhoA/Rho-associated kinase and arginase constitutes a potential therapeutic strategy to protect the diabetic heart against ischaemia-reperfusion injury.

"A Variable Ratio Gearbox (VRG) can be used in the drivetrain of a small to medium-size wind turbine to improve aerodynamic efficiency. Currently, all commercially-available wind turbines operate using a fixed-gear ratio between the turbine rotor and electrical generator. A VRG allows wind turbines, with a constant-speed generator, to discretely vary rotor speed and to achieve greater aerodynamic efficiency. The authors' previous results demonstrate the viability of the VRG design. This research quantifies the gain in efficiency for a VRG-enabled wind turbine based on wind data from representing all seven wind classifications. A method is also presented to identify turbine sites that provide the VRG with the greatest opportunities to increase production. The overall findings suggest that the VRG can benefit all wind turbines, irrespective of wind class, with some wind profiles in the study experiencing gains greater than 10%. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"As muscle activity during growth is considerably important for mandible quality and morphology, reducing dietary loading directly influences the development and metabolic activity of mandibular condylar cartilage (MCC). However, an overall investigation of changes in the protein composition of MCC has not been fully described in literature. To study the protein expression and putative signaling in vivo, we evaluated the structural changes of MCC and differentially expressed proteins induced by reducing functional loading in rat MCC at developmental stages. Isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation-based 2D nano-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) technologies were used. Global protein profiling, KEGG and PANTHER pathways, and functional categories were analyzed. Consequently, histological and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining indicated the altered histological structure of condylar cartilage and increased bone remodeling activity in hard-diet group. A total of 805 differentially expressed proteins were then identified. GO analysis revealed a significant number of proteins involved in the metabolic process, cellular process, biological regulation, localization, developmental process, and response to stimulus. KEGG pathway analysis also suggested that these proteins participated in various signaling pathways, including calcium signaling pathway, gap junction, ErbB signaling pathway, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Collagen types I and II were further validated by immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis. Taken together, the present study provides an insight into the molecular mechanism of regulating condylar growth and remodeling induced by reducing dietary loading at the protein level.

"Background: Ethanol photosynthetic production based on cyanobacteria cell factories utilizing CO2 and solar energy provides an attractive solution for sustainable production of green fuels. However, the scaling up processes of cyanobacteria cell factories were usually threatened or even devastated by biocontaminations, which restricted biomass or products accumulations of cyanobacteria cells. Thus it is of great significance to develop reliable bio-contamination- controlling strategies for promoting ethanol photosynthetic production in large scales. Results: The scaling up process of a previously developed Synechocystis strain Syn-HZ24 for ethanol synthesis was severely inhibited and devastated by a specific contaminant, Pannonibacter phragmitetus, which overcame the growths of cyanobacteria cells and completely consumed the ethanol accumulation in the cultivation systems. Physiological analysis revealed that growths and ethanol-consuming activities of the contaminant were sensitive to alkaline conditions, while ethanol-synthesizing cyanobacteria strain Syn-HZ24 could tolerate alkaline pH conditions as high as 11.0, indicating that pH-increasing strategy might be a feasible approach for rescuing ethanol photosynthetic production in outdoor cultivation systems. Thus, we designed and evaluated a Bicarbonate-based Integrated Carbon Capture System (BICCS) derived pH-rising strategy to rescue the ethanol photosynthetic production in non-sterilized conditions. In lab scale artificially simulated systems, pH values of BG11 culture medium were maintained around 11.0 by 180 mM NaHCO3 and air steam, under which the infection of Pannonibacter phragmitetus was significantly restricted, recovering ethanol production of Syn-HZ24 by about 80%. As for outdoor cultivations, ethanol photosynthetic production of Syn-HZ24 was also successfully rescued by the BICCS-derived pH-rising strategy, obtaining a final ethanol concentration of 0.9 g/L after 10 days cultivation. Conclusions: In this work, a novel product-consuming biocontamination pattern in cyanobacteria cultivations, causing devastated ethanol photosynthetic production, was identified and characterized. Physiological analysis of the essential ethanol-consuming contaminant directed the design and application of a pH-rising strategy, which effectively and selectively controlled the contamination and rescued ethanol photosynthetic production. Our work demonstrated the importance of reliable contamination control systems and strategies for large scale outdoor cultivations of cyanobacteria, and provided an inspiring paradigm for targeting effective solutions.

"Aim: Increased afferent fibre activity contributes to pathological conditions such as the overactive bladder syndrome. Nerve fibres running near the urothelium are considered to be afferent as no efferent system has yet been described. The aim of this study was to identify sub-types of afferent nerve fibres in the mouse bladder wall based on morphological criteria and analyse regional differences. Materials and methods: 27 bladders of six month old C57BL/6 mice were removed and tissues were processed for immunohistochemistry. Cryostat sections were cut and stained for Protein Gene Product 9.5 (PGP), calcitonin gene related polypeptide (CGRP), neurofilament (NF), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Results: In the sub-urothelium, different types of afferent nerve fibre were found, i.e. immunoreactive (IR) to; CGRP, NF, VAChT, and/or nNOS. At the bladder base, the sub-urothelium was more densely innervated by CGRP-IR and VAChT-IR nerve fibres, then at the lateral wall. NF- and nNOS nerves were sparsely distributed in the sub-urothelium throughout the bladder. At the lateral wall the inner muscle is densely innervated by CGRP-IR nerve fibres. NF, VAChT and nNOS nerves were evenly distributed in the different muscle layers throughout the bladder. Nerve fibre terminals expressing CGRP and NF were found within the extra-mural ganglia at the bladder base. Conclusions: Different types of afferent nerve fibres were identified in the sub-urothelium of the mouse bladder. At the bladder base the sub-urothelium is more densely innervated than the lateral wall by CGRP-IR and VAChT-IR afferent nerve fibres. CGRP and NF afferent nerve fibres in the muscle layer probably relay afferent input to external ganglia located near the bladder base. The identification of different afferent nerves in the sub-urothelium suggests a functional heterogeneity of the afferent nerve fibres in the urinary bladder. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"As the prevalence of embedded systems in various fields has spread, real-time operating systems (RTOSs) have been widely used for many years satisfying real-time requirements and a multitasking design. The use of RTOS adds additional overhead to a system, which should be deliberately considered and evaluated in some critical systems. This paper presents a qualitative and quantitative comparison between an open-source RTOS (FreeRTOS V8.0.0) and a commercial one (mu C/OS-III). Both RTOS use a preemptive multitasking kernel, with additional support for round robin scheduling. We aim to benchmark and evaluate their performance and behaviour, including seven performance tests and two behaviour tests. Comparing the measurement results shows that the commercial mu C/OS-III does not behave much better than FreeRTOS. Furthermore, we discovered that the priority changing function of mu C/OSIII does not behave correctly in some circumstances. Although FreeRTOS has no such problem in the latest version, it still has a problem with its dynamic memory management.

Case of need, design specification and fabrication of the steerable bougie mechanism is discussed. Aims Identify the need for a novel steerable bougie whilst considering technology readiness levels associated with medical device design. Analyse and produce suitable mechanisms utilising smart materials to increase device functionality aiding successful patient intubation procedures. Methods This work describes the total design activity that contributes to the successful development of medical devices, from case of need, to smart material actuation mechanisms. Research focuses on identifying a suitable control mechanism to allow a steerable tip to be integrated into a bougie with a control device attached to the laryngoscope. Results Data collected from a user group survey supported the development of a novel bougie, with better shape retention, variable rigidity within the tip, and an integrated steerable function. Analysis of several mechanisms, artificial muscles, and smart materials identified a cost-effective steerable mechanism that can be incorporated into a bougie. Conclusion Users have defined a need for an improved bougie. Controlling smart materials and mechanisms, within the predefined dimensions, identified strengths and weaknesses associated with steerable functions. The performance of the selected mechanism for incorporation requires a high level of control to accurately steer a device within the human airway.

"As the first component of SPARC (Simulation Package for Ab-initio Real-space Calculations), we present an accurate and efficient finite-difference formulation and parallel implementation of Density Functional Theory (DFT) for isolated clusters. Specifically, utilizing a local reformulation of the electrostatics, the Chebyshev polynomial filtered self-consistent field iteration, and a reformulation of the non-local component of the force, we develop a framework using the finite-difference representation that enables the efficient evaluation of energies and atomic forces to within the desired accuracies in DFT. Through selected examples consisting of a variety of elements, we demonstrate that SPARC obtains exponential convergence in energy and forces with domain size; systematic convergence in the energy and forces with mesh-size to reference plane-wave result at comparably high rates; forces that are consistent with the energy, both free from any noticeable 'egg-box' effect; and accurate ground-state properties including equilibrium geometries and vibrational spectra. In addition, for systems consisting up to thousands of electrons, SPARC displays weak and strong parallel scaling behavior that is similar to well-established and optimized plane-wave implementations, but with a significantly reduced prefactor. Overall, SPARC represents an attractive alternative to plane-wave codes for practical DFT simulations of isolated clusters.

"Background: Restricting access to lethal means is a well-established strategy for suicide prevention. However, the hypothesis of subsequent method substitution remains difficult to verify. In the case of jumping from high places ('hotspots'), most studies have been unable to control for a potential shift in suicide locations. This investigation aims to evaluate the short-and long-term effect of safety barriers on Brisbane's Gateway Bridge and to examine whether there was substitution of suicide location. Methods: Data on suicide by jumping - between 1990 and 2012, in Brisbane, Australia were obtained from the Queensland Suicide Register. The effects of barrier installation at the Gateway Bridge were assessed through a natural experiment setting. Descriptive and Poisson regression analyses were used. Results: Of the 277 suicides by jumping in Brisbane that were identified, almost half (n = 126) occurred from the Gateway or Story Bridges. After the installation of barriers on the Gateway Bridge, in 1993, the number of suicides from this site dropped 53.0% in the period 1994-1997 (p = 0.041) and a further reduction was found in subsequent years. Analyses confirmed that there was no evidence of displacement to a neighbouring suicide hotspot (Story Bridge) or other locations. Conclusions: The safety barriers were effective in preventing suicide from the Gateway Bridge, and no evidence of substitution of location was found.

"Base stations equipped with resources to harvest renewable energy are not only environment-friendly but can also reduce the grid energy consumed, thus bringing cost savings for the cellular network operators. Intelligent management of the harvested energy can further increase the cost savings. Such management of energy savings has to be carefully coupled with managing the quality of service so as to ensure customer satisfaction. In such a process, there is a trade-off between the energy drawn from grid and the quality of service. Unlike prior studies which mainly focus on network energy minimization, this paper proposes a framework for jointly managing the grid energy savings and the quality of service (in terms of the network latency), which is achieved by downlink power control and user association reconfiguration. We use a real BS deployment scenario from London, U.K., to show the performance of our proposed framework and compare it against existing benchmarks. We show that the proposed framework can lead to around 60% grid energy savings as well as better network latency performance than the traditionally used scheme.

"ARINC 653 provides a strong isolation mechanism for safety computing fields, such as aircrafts. seL4, a 3rd generation microkernel, was formally verified for its functional correctness and provides a desirable code base for partitioning operating systems. But there is a long way from seL4 to partitioning. We take the first step and focus on the temporal aspect, i.e., implementing a partitioned scheduler based on seL4. However, seL4 implements a stiff scheduler inside the kernel, which conflicts with the genera principles(eg. ARINC 653 standard) of temporal partitioning. To address this problem, we propose a user-mode approach. We also elaborate performance of our scheduler.

"Biocrusts are critical components of desert ecosystems, significantly modifying the surfaces they occupy. The mixture of biological components and soil particles that form the crust, in conjunction with moisture, determines the biocrusts' spectral signatures. Proximal and remote sensing in complemeritary spectral regions, namely the reflective region, and the thermal region, have been used to study biocrusts in a non-destructive manner, in the laboratory, in the field, and from space. The objectives of this review paper are to present the spectral characteristics of biocrusts across the optical domain, and to discuss significant developments in the application of proximal and remote sensing for biocrust studies in the last few years. The motivation for using proximal and remote sensing in biocrust studies is disttissed. Next, the application of reflectance spectroscopy to the study of biocrusts is presented followed by a review of the emergence of high spectral resolution thermal remote sensing, Which facilitates the application of thermal spectroscopy for biocrust studies. Four specific topics at the forefront of proximal and remote sensing of biocrusts are discussed: (1) The use of remote sensing in determining the role of biocrusts in global biogeochemical cycles; (2) Monitoring the inceptive establishment of biocrusts; (3) Identifying and characterizing biocrusts using Longwave infrared spectroscopy; and (4) Diurnal emissivity dynamics of biocrusts in a sand dune environment. The paper concludes by identifying innovative technologies such as low altitude and high resolution imagery that are increasingly used in remote sensing science, and are expected to be used in future biocrusts studies.

"As 3D technology, including computer graphics, virtual reality and 3D printing, has been rapidly developed in the past years, 3D models are gaining an increasingly huge demand. Traditional 3D modeling platforms such as Maya and ZBrush, utilize ""windows, icons, menus, pointers"" (WIMP) interface paradigms for fine-grained control to construct detailed models. However, the modeling progress can be tedious and frustrating and thus too hard for a novice user or even a well trained artist. Therefore, a more intuitive interface is needed. Sketch, an intuitive communication and modeling tool for human beings, becomes the first choice of modeling community. So far, various sketch-based modeling systems have been created and studied. In this paper, we attempt to show how these systems work and give a comprehensive survey.We review and categorize the systems in four aspects: the input, the knowledge they use, the modeling approach and the output. We also discuss about inherent challenges and open problems for researchers in the future.

"Aim: To identify if there is a relationship between the deiodinase D2-Thr92Ala genetic variant, thyroid hormone levels and biochemical hypothyroidism in preeclampsia.Materials and methods: We genotyped 125 women with preeclampsia and 131 normal pregnant women using PCR-RFLP. Serum thyroid hormone levels were determined using ELISA.Results: Our study showed higher TSH and FT4 levels and lower FT3 levels in women with preeclampsia compared to normal pregnant women, with statistical significance for women with mild and severe preeclampsia. The risk to develop pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), mild or severe preeclampsia was increased in carriers of at least one D2-Ala92 allele. TSH and FT4 levels were significantly higher and FT3 levels were significantly lower in preeclamptic women with severe preeclampsia if they carried the D2-Ala92 allele compared to non-carriers. Pregnant women with PIH and mild preeclampsia, carriers of at least one D2-Ala92 allele, delivered at lower gestational age neonates with a lower birth weight compared to non-carriers, but the results were statistically significant only in severe preeclampsia.Conclusion: The D2-Thr92Ala genetic variant is associated with the severity and the obstetric outcome of preeclampsia, and it also influences thyroid hormone levels. The study demonstrates non-thyroidal biochemical hypothyroidism - as a result of deiodination effects due to D2 genotypes.

"A system is described for determination of discrete pulse train characteristics of multi spot laser delivery systems for retinal photocoagulation. While photodiodes provide an ideal detection mechanism, measurement artifacts can potentially be introduced by the spatial pattern of the delivered beam relative to a discrete photodiode element. This problem was overcome by use of an integrating sphere to produce a uniform light field at the site of the photodiode detector. A basic current driven photodiode detection circuit incorporating an operational amplifier was used to generate a signal captured by a commercially available USB interface device at a rate of 10 kHz. Studies were undertaken of a Topcon Pascal Streamline laser system with output at a wavelength of 577 nm (yellow). This laser features the proprietary feature of 'Endpoint Management'(TM) where pulses can be delivered as 100% of set energy levels with visible reaction on the retina and also at a reduced energy level to create potentially non visible but clinically effective lesions. Using the pulse train measurement device it was identified that the 'Endpoint Management'(TM) delivery mode of pulses of lower energy was achieved by reducing the pulse duration of pulses for non-visible effect pulses while maintaining consistent beam power levels within the delivered pulse profile. The effect of eye geometry in determining safety and effectiveness of multi spot laser delivery for retinal photocoagulation is discussed. (C) 2015 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"As scientific and technological innovation has become a key component of economic growth, policies geared towards reinforcing education in these areas have become a priority. Due the exponential growth of technologies based on or relaying on software, one of the key skills identified as a basic literacy for the future is computer programming. In consequence several countries are taking steps to introduce coding in education, however, the speed at which this skill is becoming essential demands its prompt introduction at all levels. While the steps being taken in primary and secondary education are widely discussed, the extent to which computer programming has been introduced in higher education is less known; are universities addressing this demand, and if so how? Taking design education as a case study, we approach these questions by asking faculty from design schools in different countries whether their respective institutions offer any computer programming courses and in which modality. After laying down the theoretical framework for the discussion, we use a mix of qualitative interviews and questionnaires to gather information and finally discuss how the steps being taken in primary and secondary education could serve as a reference in higher education. We close by reflecting upon the implications of the information obtained to develop a work force capable of not just using technology, but creating it. (C) 2015 The Authors.

"Aim. This paper is a report of a study of factors that affect turnover of newly licensed registered nurses in United States hospitals. Background. There is a large body of research related to nursing retention; however, there is little information specific to newly licensed registered nurse turnover. Incidence rates of turnover among new nurses are unknown because most turnover data are not from nationally representative samples of nurses. Method. This study used a longitudinal panel design to obtain data from 1653 registered nurses who were recently licensed by examination for the first time. We mailed surveys to a nationally representative sample of hospital registered nurses 1 year apart. The analytic sample consisted of 1653 nurses who responded to both survey mailings in January of 2006 and 2007. Results. Full-time employment and more sprains and strains (including back injuries) result in more turnover. Higher intent to stay and hours of voluntary overtime and more than one job for pay reduces turnover. When we omitted intent to stay from the probit model, less job satisfaction and organizational commitment led to more turnover, confirming their importance to turnover. Magnet Recognition Award (R) hospitals and several other work attributes had no effect on turnover. Conclusion. Turnover problems are complex, which means that there is no one solution to decreasing turnover. Multiple points of intervention exist. One specific approach that may improve turnover rates is hospital policies that reduce strains and sprains.

"Active queue management (AQM) is an effective solution for the congestion control problem. It can achieve high quality of service (QoS) by reducing the packet dropping probability and network utilization. Three robust control algorithms are proposed in this paper in order to design robust AQM schemes: conventional H controller, robust particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based PID (proportional-integral-derivative) (PSOPID) controller, and robust ant-colony optimization (ACO)-based PID (ACOPID) controller. PSO and ACO methods are used to tune the PID controller parameters subject to H constraints to achieve the required robustness of the network. Robust PSOPID and ACOPID controllers can achieve desirable time-response specifications with a simple design procedure and low-order controller in comparison to the conventional H controller. Wide ranges of system parameters change are used to show the robustness of the designed controllers. The ability of the designed controllers to meet the specified performance is demonstrated using MATLAB 7. 11, (R2010b): The MathWorks, Inc.3 Apple Hill Drive Natick, MA USA. On the other hand, to verify the effectiveness of the designed controller, nonlinear simulation is performed using the NS2 package. Finally, it is shown by comparison that the proposed robust ACOPID can achieve more desirable performance than the PSOPID controller and the controllers that have been proposed in previous works.

"Aim. Although physical activity brings a range of lifelong health benefits, it may also lead to injuries that pose a significant threat to health. It is particularly noticeable in people involved in professional sports where sport-related injuries commonly occur and are associated with intense exercise which aims to improve physical fitness. The article attempts to determine incidence of sports injuries reported by Plus League volleyball players, as well as to identify their most common types and causes. Methods. The research project involved 90 Plus League volleyball players aged 18-37 with the average age of 25.11 (SD +/- 5.378). A method of diagnostic survey was applied to collect empirical data by means of questionnaire developed by the authors (researchers). The results were statistically analysed and verified with the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi(2) test at the significance level (or critical P-value) of P <= 0.05 Results. Over 87% of the respondents suffered from at least one sport-related injury. In total, 362 injuries occurred, on average 4.02 injuries per one volleyball player. The most common sports injuries involved ankle or talocrural joint (46 injuries), knee and lower leg muscles (30), interphalangeal articulations of fingers (30) as well as shoulder joint. More than half of the injuries (57%) occurred twice or three times. Volleyball players commonly sustain injuries through contact with an opposing player in competition. Sport-specific injuries may also occur due to exhaustion, lack of rest and undertreated injuries. Conclusion. The most common volleyball-related injuries are primarily talocrural joint, hand and shoulder injuries. Common types of injuries that can affect volleyball players include muscles, joints and ligaments injuries, sprains and strains as well as bruises. Most of these injuries are caused by exhaustion, contact with an opposing player during competition and fatigue. The incidence of sport-related injuries seems to be influenced by such factors as somatic features, jumping parameters and the length of professional volleyball career.

"At present, China's grain production pattern runs counter to the distribution patterns of farmland resources and water-heat conditions. It is urgently important to conduct research on the spatial matching of grain production and farmland resources. Based on the Potential Crop Rotation data, with regards to the situations of irrigation and rain feeding, this paper builds a measuring model of potential farmland, and separately measures the spatial matching/index of grain yield with actual and potential farmland resources, thus revealing China's grain production pattern. The results indicate that serious spatial mismatch exists between grain production and farmland resources in China. Take the potential crop rotation system into consideration, the spatial mismatch of grain yield and potential farmland resources has been aggravated by the grain production barycenter's shift to the north China, with low Crop Rotation Index. The function-promoting regions of grain production in China are going through two evolution patterns of ""northward and southward expansion"" and ""westward movement and northward expansion,"" respectively. Inefficient use of farmland mainly occurs in the fragile ecological environments, such as the farming-pastoral ecotone of Northern China, the northwest area of Xinjiang and the southwest karst landform areas. The inefficient use of and the decreasing amount of available farmland have become the main causes of the decline in grain production. The problems facing Chinese agriculture caused by the spatial mismatch include the imbalance in regional structures, ecological risks, agricultural production risks, and the risk of food price. In order to cope with these problems, this paper provides some advices on protecting farmland acreage, expanding farmland potential, ensuring the safety of water resources, and extending the industrial grain chain. Our paper additionally proposes policy reforms and innovations designed to ensure the implementation of the above measures, so as to commonly defuse China's food security crisis.

"A switchable operational amplifier (opamp) is examined in this brief. It is based on a current-mirror opamp with switchable transconductance values. Contrary to switched opamp (SO) and partial SO, it can be used to realize both half-delay and full-delay switched-capacitor integrators. The added circuit design complexity is shown to be minimal. Optimal switching is developed in this brief. It is also shown in this brief that the absolute average power consumption can be less as compared with an SO design. The experimental results of a delta-sigma modulator prototype (designed in 1-V 65-nm CMOS), employing the designated switchable-opamp technique, show power reduction without any degradation in SNDR (58.5 dB) or SFDR (67 dB).

"AimInterleukin 23 (IL-23) and its receptor (IL-23R) seem to play a major role in differentiation of CD4(+) T cells into Th17 cells, induction of IL-17 production, and activation of inflammatory pathways. Recent studies have suggested the association of IL-23R polymorphisms with bone and articular inflammation in diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of this study was to determine the association between IL-23R polymorphisms and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). MethodA case-control study on 55 patients with JIA and 78 healthy controls was performed. All samples were genotyped for eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL23R (rs1004819, rs2201841, rs10889677, rs1495965, rs7517847, rs10489629, rs11209026 and rs1343151), using real-time polymerase chain reaction Taqman genotyping technique. Forty-two patients and 42 healthy controls were chosen randomly to measure the level of serum IL-17A using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. ResultsAlthough the heterozygous genotype of rs1004819 (GA) showed a weak, but statistically significant protective effect on polyarticular subtype (P=0.03), none of the selected SNPs were associated with JIA overall. Indeed the analysis of haplotypes did not show any significant association with JIA. Serum IL-17A level was not significantly different among patients and healthy controls and between JIA subtypes, as well. Moreover, there was no significant correlation between SNPs and serum IL-17A concentration. ConclusionThis is the first study of the IL-23R gene in Iranian patients with JIA. Our results did not show any strong association between IL-23R polymorphisms and JIA disease or serum IL-17A levels. The only association was seen between rs1004819 and polyarticular JIA. Further larger studies may help clarify the role, if any, of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway in the pathogenesis of JIA.

"A systematic data-based design method for tuning proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers for disturbance attenuation is proposed. In this method, a set of closed-loop plant data are directly exploited without using a process model. PID controller parameters for a control system that behaves as closely as possible to the reference model for disturbance rejection are derived. Two algorithms are developed to calculate the PID parameters. One algorithm determines the optimal time delay in the reference model by solving an optimization problem, whereas the other algorithm avoids the nonlinear optimization by using a simple approximation for the time delay term, enabling derivation of analytical PID tuning formulas. Because plant data integrals are used in the regression equations for calculating PID parameters, the two proposed algorithms are robust against measurement noises. Moreover, the controller tuning involves an adjustable design parameter that enables the user to achieve a trade-off between performance and robustness. Because of its closed-loop tuning capability, the proposed method can be applied online to improve (retune) existing underperforming controllers for stable, integrating, and unstable plants. Simulation examples covering a wide variety of process dynamics, including two examples related to reactor systems, are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tuning method.

"Aim: The role of uric acid as a risk factor for cardio-cerebrovascular diseases is controversial. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between serum uric acid level and the risk of cardio-cerebrovascular events in middle-aged and non-obese Chinese men. Methods: We included 3152 participants from the health examination center of Tongji Hospital from June 2007 to June 2010. Clinical examination and medical records were collected at the annual health examination. The hazard ratios (HRs) of uric acid for cardio-cerebrovascular events were calculated by Cox proportional hazards models. Generalized additive model and threshold effect analysis were used to explore the non-linear relationship between serum uric acid level and the incidence of cardio-cerebrovascular event. Result: The mean follow-up time was 52 months. When the participants were classified into four groups by the serum acid quarter (Q1-Q4), the HRs (95% CI) of Q2-Q4 for cardio-cerebrovascular events were 1.26 (0.83, 1.92), 1.97 (1.33, 2.91) and 2.05 (1.40, 3.01), respectively, compared with the reference (Q1). The actual incidence and conditional incidence of cardio-cerebrovascular events in the high serum acid group were higher than those in the low serum acid group, which were stratified by the turning point (sUA = 372 mu mol/L). We also showed a strong prognostic accuracy of the multiple variable-based score in 3 years and 5 years, with area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.790 (0.756-0.823) and 0.777 (0.749-0.804), respectively. Conclusion: Serum uric acid level is a strong risk factor for cardio-cerebrovascular events.

"As a result of rapid advances in technology and computer programming, algorithms are increasingly able to generate expressive material. In light of these advances, it is inevitable that courts will be asked to determine whether this algorithmically generated content is protected expression under section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Although algorithmically generated content can serve many of the same constitutionally-protected purposes as human expression, this paper explains why the Supreme Court of Canada's current framework is inadequate for use in the context of algorithmically generated content. This paper offers a proactive and principled solution that is consistent with the fundamental principles of freedom of expression articulated by the Court in R v Keegstra. This solution allows content that upholds the Keegstra principles to be protected despite the fact that the algorithm's creator may not have contemplated the specific content.

"A study on the hydrodynamic modelling of pontoon bridges is presented, and exemplified with the Bergsoysund Bridge. The structural modelling is based on the finite element method using the FE-software ABAQUS; the fluid-structure interaction, as well as the wave action, are modelled applying linearized potential theory represented by the DNV HydroD WADAM software. The main emphasis is put on the stochastic response analysis within the framework of the power spectral density method. The accuracy of the presented modelling is outlined. Convergence of the response obtained by modal technique is dealt with. By means of state-space representation and an iteration algorithm, the quadratic eigenvalue problem is solved. Contribution from the fluid-structure interaction to the overall modal damping is presented and discussed, and is found to be significant. Critical damping ratios close to 11%, corresponding to modes with natural frequency around 1 rad/s, are found. The displacement response is considered near-converged when approximately 30 modes are included.

"Benchmarks are required to determine the environmental performance of new buildings. Through LCA, this study assessed the environmental impacts of 23 elementary school buildings in South Korea. By conducting statistical analysis (Pearson correlation analysis, partial correlation analysis, and Mann-Whitney test), gross floor area, latitude, and longitude were influence factors which cause the differences in environmental impacts among buildings. The differences in environmental impacts by gross floor area can be considered by defining the functional unit as one square meter of floor area. The differences in environmental impacts by region can be considered after dividing 23 elementary school buildings according to latitude and longitude. Based on the results of the two-step cluster analysis and the Mann-Whitney test on latitude and longitude, the environmental impacts of 23 elementary school buildings were divided into two clusters, with the exception of human carcinogenic potential and human non-carcinogenic potential. Therefore, this study presented the benchmarks in two clusters. For instance, the benchmarks for global warming potential in Clusters One and Two were 3.70E+03 and 2.53E+03 kg-CO2 eq./m(2), respectively. The benchmark for the human carcinogenic potential was 8.63E-08 cases(can)/m(2).

"Based on the monitoring data of 78 monitoring stations from 2003 to 2012, five key water quality indexes (biochemical oxygen demand: BOD5, permanganate index: CODMn, dissolved oxygen: DO, ammonium nitrogen: NH3-N, and total phosphorus: TP) were selected to analyze their temporal and spatial characteristics in the highly disturbed Huaihe River Basin via Mann-Kendall trend analysis and boxplot analysis. The temporal and spatial variations of water pollutant concentrations in the Huaihe River Basin were investigated and analyzed to provide a scientific basis for water pollution control, water environment protection, and ecological restoration. The results indicated that the Yinghe River, Quanhe River, Honghe River, Guohe River, and Baohe River were the most seriously polluted rivers, followed by Hongze Lake, Luoma Lake, Yishuhe River, and Nansi Lake. BOD5, CODMn, and NH3-N were the major pollution indexes, for which the monitoring stations reported that more than 40 % of the water quality concentrations exceeded the class IV level. There were 21, 50, 36, and 21 monitoring stations that recorded significantly decreasing trends for BOD5, CODMn, NH3-N, and TP, respectively, and 39 monitoring stations showed a significantly increasing trend for DO. Moreover, the water quality concentrations had a certain concentricity and volatility according to boxplot analysis for the 20 monitoring stations. The majority of monitoring stations recorded a large fluctuation for the monitoring indexes in 2003 and 2004, which indicated that the water quality concentrations were unstable. According to the seasonal variations of the water quality concentrations in the mainstream of Huaihe River, the monthly variation trends of the BOD5, CODMn, DO, NH3-N, and TP concentrations were basically consistent among the seven monitoring stations. The BOD5, CODMn, NH3 -N, and TP concentrations were affected by the change of the stream discharge; changes in DO and NH3-N concentrations were influenced by the regional environmental temperature, and the DO and NH3-N concentrations decreased when the water temperature increased.

"As one of the variations in frequent pattern mining, erasable pattern mining discovers patterns with benefits lower than or equal to a user-specified threshold from a product database. Although traditional erasable pattern mining algorithms can perform their own mining operations on static mining environments, they are not suitable for dealing with dynamic data stream environments. In such dynamic data streams, algorithms have to process them immediately with only one database scan in order to consider characteristics of data stream mining. However, previous tree-based erasable pattern mining methods have difficulty in processing dynamic data streams because they need two or more database scans to construct their own tree structures. In addition, they do not also consider specific information of each item within a product database, but they need to conduct mining operations considering such additional information of the items in order to find more useful erasable pattern results. For this reason, in this paper, we propose a weighted erasable pattern mining algorithm suitable for sliding window-based data stream environments. The algorithm employs tree and list data structures for more efficient mining processes and solves the problems of previous erasable pattern mining approaches by using a sliding window-based stream processing technique and an item weight-based pattern pruning method. We compare performance of the proposed algorithm to state-of-the-art tree-based approaches with respect to various real and synthetic datasets. Experimental results show that our method is more efficient and scalable than the competitors in terms of runtime, memory, and pattern generation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Availability of safe drinking water is considered a key challenge in the coastal region of Bangladesh. High concentrations of salinity, iron and arsenic, and the unavailability of suitable aquifers, have deterred the exploitation of groundwater resources. In addition the cyclonic storm surge is a major threat to this system. Cyclones accompanied by storm surges in the coastal area cause significant deterioration of drinking water supply and sanitation. Water professionals have launched some initiatives to promote small-scale, alternative safe water sources (e. g. rainwater harvesting, pond sand filters and piped water techniques) to provide sustainable solutions to the problem. However, a systematic evaluation of the alternatives that considers social, technical and economic criteria has not been carried out so far. The present study is an attempt to evaluate the alternative options for drinking water supply in a cyclone-prone area. The authors conducted a multi-criteria analysis and reached the conclusion that rainwater harvesting is the most suitable option for the area. Moreover, the final result was shared with the users to obtain their feedback to ensure sustainability of the water source.

"A state-space formulation for the aerodynamics of flapping flight is presented.

The aspect ratio effects on the empirical formulae used to predict the static lift due to a stabilized Leading Edge Vortex (LEV) are provided. The unsteady lift due to arbitrary wing motion is generated using the static lift curve. Then, state-space representation for the unsteady lift is derived. The proposed model is validated through a comparison with direct numerical simulations of Navier-Stokes on hovering insects. A comparison with quasi-steady models that capture the LEV contribution is also performed to assess the role of unsteadiness. Similarly, a comparison with classical unsteady approaches is presented to assess the LEV dominance.

"A systematic non-probabilistic reliability analysis procedure for structural vibration active control system with unknown-but-bounded parameters is proposed. The state-space representation of active vibration control system with uncertain parameters is presented. Compared with the robust control theory, which is always over-conservative, the reliability-based analysis method is more suitable to deal with uncertain problem. Stability is the core of the closed-loop feedback control system design, so stability criterion is adopted to act as the limited state function for reliability analysis. The uncertain parameters without enough samples are modeled as interval variables. Interval perturbation method is employed to estimate the interval bounds of eigenvalues, which can be used to characterize the stability of the closed-loop active control system. Formulation of defining the reliability of active control system based on stability is discussed. A novel non-probabilistic reliability measurement index is discussed and used to determine the probability of the stability based on the area ratio. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated by two numerical examples. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Background: Supraspinatus tears are common in pitchers. However, the effect of these tears on glenohumeral (GH) mechanics is incompletely understood. Purpose/Hypothesis: To describe the effect of supraspinatus tears and repairs on GH kinematics during an abbreviated throwing motion using the intact shoulder girdle. The hypothesis was that supraspinatus tears would lead to an increase of GH translation in the coronal plane and supraspinatus repairs would restore GH kinematics. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Six shoulders from 3 fresh-frozen cadavers were tested in a novel 7 degrees of freedom robotic testing system. Torsos were mounted and the wrist was pinned to an actuator mounted on an upper frame. After the deltoid was removed, the shoulders were studied during an abbreviated throwing motion (ATM) from maximum external rotation to the midcoronal plane to establish a baseline. The ATM was repeated after creation of a 1-cm supraspinatus tear, after creation of a 3-cm supraspinatus tear, and after repair with a transosseous equivalent (TOE) technique. Retroreflective bone markers and high-speed infrared cameras were used to measure GH kinematics and calculate the center of rotation of the GH joint (CORGH) instantaneously. Results: The 1- and 3-cm supraspinatus tears did not significantly alter GH translation. The TOE repair shifted the CORGH posteriorly, as evidenced by a significant decrease in the overall GH translation in all 3 planes (P = .003, .019, and .026, for x-y, y-z, and x-z planes, respectively). Conclusion: In contrast to a TOE repair of the supraspinatus tendon, isolated supraspinatus tears did not perturb GH kinematics in this cadaveric model of the throwing shoulder. Clinical Relevance: In throwing athletes, treatment of rotator cuff tears should be addressed with caution to avoid an unintended alteration in GH kinematics due to overtightening of the tendon.

"Aim: The Program to Access and Review Trending iNformation and Evaluate coRrelation to Symptoms in patients with Heart Failure (PARTNERS HF) trial elaborated a multiparametric model for prediction of acute decompensation in advanced heart failure patients, based on periodical in office data download from cardiac resynchronisation devices. In this study, we evaluated the ability of the PARTNERS HF criteria to detect initial decompensation in a population of moderate heart failure patients under remote monitoring. Methods: We retrospectively applied the PARTNERS HF criteria to 1860 transmissions from 104 patients (median follow up 21 months; range 1-67 months), who were enrolled in our programme of telemedicine after cardiac resynchronisation therapy. We tested the ability of a score based on these criteria to predict any acute clinical decompensation occurring in the 15 days following a transmission. Results: In 441 cases, acute heart failure was diagnosed after the index transmission. The area under the curve (AUC) of the score for the diagnosis of acute decompensation was 0.752 (confidence interval (CI) 95% 0.728-0.777). The best score cut-off was consistent with the results of PARTNERS HF: with a score >= 2, sensitivity was 75% and specificity 68%. The odds ratio for events was 6.24 (CI 95% 4.90-7.95; p<0.001). Conclusions: When retrospectively applied to remote monitoring transmissions and arranged in a score, PARTNERS HF criteria could identify HF patients who subsequently developed acute decompensation. These results warrant prospective studies applying PARTNERS HF criteria to remote monitoring.

"A voice commanded electronic wheelchair controller was implemented to be controlled remotely by voice commands, in which the Google speaker-independent voice recognition engine, the GPS guiding Google map, and the Bluetooth communication technology were used. The smart phone was programed to be used as a remote controller for seven voice commands: left, right, forward, backward, faster, slower, stop. Those commands were used with a word ""command"" to increase the recognition accuracy. Information of the location and the moved distance of the chair were shown on the google map. The command recognition time of the smart phone for each one of the seven commands was measured by changing of the number of several voice commands.

The investigation revealed that in the presence of CNT, the photocatalyst performance increases significantly becomes approximately twice. The superior activity witnessed here for the ternary nanocomposite (CuO-ZnO/ CNT) was explained in terms of the ability of CNT to enlarge the photocatalyst surface area, enhance the absorption of photons, and prohibit the recombination of photogenerated e/h pairs.

Additionally, the strength parameters obtained from traditional and repeated shear tests were both used to analyze global stability along the liner system of a typical landfill.

"Articular bone erosion in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is mediated by the interaction between inflammation and pathways regulating bone metabolism. Inflammation promotes osteoclastogenesis and also inhibits osteoblast function, further contributing to the persistence of erosions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of skeletal remodeling and play a role in RA pathogenesis. We therefore determined the expression of miRNAs in inflamed synovial tissue and the role they play in pathways regulating osteoblast and osteoclast function. Using the serum transfer mouse model of RA in C57BL/6 mice, we performed Fluidigm high-throughput qPCR-based screening of miRNAs from nonarthritic and arthritic mice. Global gene expression profiling was also performed on Affymetrix microarrays from these same synovial samples. miRNA and mRNA expression profiles were subjected to comparative bioinformatics. A total of 536 upregulated genes and 417 downregulated genes were identified that are predicted targets of miRNAs with reciprocal expression changes. Gene ontology analysis of these genes revealed significant enrichment in skeletal pathways. Of the 22 miRNAs whose expression was most significantly changed (p < 0.01) between nonarthritic and arthritic mice, we identified their targets that both inhibit and promote bone formation. These miRNAs are predicted to target Wnt and BMP signaling pathway components. We validated miRNA array findings and demonstrated that secretion of miR-221-3p in exosomes was upregulated by synovial fibroblasts treated with the proinflammatory cytokine TNF. Overexpression of miR-221-3p suppressed calvarial osteoblast differentiation and mineralization in vitro. These results suggest that miRNAs derived from inflamed synovial tissues may regulate signaling pathways at erosion sites that affect bone loss and potentially also compensatory bone formation.

"As mobile social networks (MSNs) are booming and gaining tremendous popularity, there have been an increasing number of communications and interactions among users. Taking this advantage, users in MSNs make decisions via collecting and combining trust information from different users. Hence, trust evaluation technology has become a key requirement for network security in MSNs. In such MSNs, however, the community/group structures are dynamically changing, and users may belong to multiple communities/groups. Therefore, trust evaluation plays a critical role in inferring trustworthy contacts among users. In this paper, an innovative trust inference model is proposed for MSNs, in which multiple dimensional trust metrics are incorporated to reflect the complexity of trust. To infer trust relations between users in MSNs with complex communities, we first construct dynamic implicit social behavioral graphs (DynISBG) based on dynamic complex community/group structures and propose an efficient detection algorithm for DynISBG under fuzzy degree kappa. We then present a multi-dimensional fuzzy trust inferring approach that involves four metrics, that is, static attribute trust factor, dynamic behavioral trust factor, long-term trust evolution factor, and recommendation-based trust opinion. Moreover, to obtain the recommendation-based trust opinion about indirect connected users, we discuss the trust aggregation and propagation along trust path. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our novel approach with simulations. The results show that, compared with the existing approaches, the proposed model provides a more detailed analysis in trust evaluation with higher accuracy. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

"Background: The actual connectivity between populations of freshwater organisms is largely determined by species biology, but is also influenced by many area-and site-specific factors, such as water pollution and habitat fragmentation. Therefore, the prediction of effective gene flow, even for well-studied organisms, is difficult. The amphipod crustacean Gammarus fossarum is a key invertebrate in freshwater ecosystems and contains many cryptic species. One of these species is the broadly distributed G. fossarum clade 11 (type B). In this study, we tested for factors driving the genetic structure of G. fossarum clade 11 in a human-impacted landscape at local and regional scales. To determine population structure, we analyzed the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (CO1) gene of 2,086 specimens from 54 sampling sites and microsatellite loci of 420 of these specimens from ten sites. Results: We detected strong overall genetic differentiation between populations at regional and local scales with both independent marker systems, often even within few kilometers. Interestingly, we observed only a weak correlation of genetic distances with geographic distances or catchment boundaries. Testing for factors explaining the observed population structure revealed, that it was mostly the colonization history, which has influenced the structure rather than any of the chosen environmental factors. Whereas the number of in-stream barriers did not explain population differentiation, the few large water reservoirs in the catchment likely act as dispersal barriers. Conclusions: We showed that populations of Gammarus fossarum clade 11 are strongly isolated even at local scales in the human-impacted region. The observed genetic structure was best explained by the effects of random genetic drift acting independently on isolated populations after historical colonization events. Genetic drift in isolated populations was probably further enhanced by anthropogenic impacts, as G. fossarum is sensitive to many anthropogenic stressors. These findings highlight the importance of small-scale genetic studies to determine barriers restricting gene flow to prevent further loss of genetic diversity and maintain intact freshwater ecosystems.

"As an important pre-filtering procedure for object detection, objectness estimation now draws lots of attentions from both the video analysis and computer vision communities. Among the existing approaches, BING [1] (binarized normed gradients) is the recently proposed one that possesses the advantages of high object detection rate, ultra fast computational speed (i.e. 300 fps), small number of proposals, and good generalization ability. However, within BING's framework, only the uniform hierarchical ranking structure and gradient information are employed for objectness characterization, which leads to high false positive rate. To address this issue, an effective and efficient cascade ranking method is proposed to refine BING, in this paper. It declares three main contributions. First, the concept of scale-sets histogram is novelly introduced. It helps to analyze the potential sizes of the objects. Secondly, more descriptive visual features (i.e. the color-texture consistence) are considered simultaneously for objectness characterization. Lastly, we propose hierarchical sorting to further leverage the ranking performance, according to the local contrast analysis between the inside and straddling superpixels of the object proposal windows. The experimental results on four challenging datasets PASCAL VOC2007, PASCAL VOC2010, PASCAL VOC2012 and ILSVRC2014 demonstrate that, the refined BING can achieve good balance between high detection rate (DR) (e.g. 96.7% DR with 1000 proposal windows on VOC2007), and low time consumption (e.g. 75 ms per image on VOC2007). It is also worth noting that, with a relatively small number of proposals (e.g. fewer than 200 proposals), our approach generally outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the detection rate, on all the testing datasets.

"A three phase free piston type double acting Stirling engine model is proposed and validated using experimental results. The modeling strategy is based on a combination of two sub-models: a global thermal model of the engine to deal with heat sources coupling and a detailed equivalent electrical network model which accounts for the gas and mechanical dynamic physics of the engine. Derived features, such as the amplitude, the frequency, the compression and the expansion powers are then finally obtained. The model is experimentally validated with a prototype of a free piston Stirling engine. Mean error on the amplitude, the frequency, the internal temperatures and the compression and expansion powers is 9%, so the model is considered accurate enough to predict performances. For optimization purpose, a numerical analysis is performed selecting the three following critical parameters: (i) dead volume of the chambers, (ii) natural frequency of the mechanical oscillators and (iii) thermal conduction between hot and cold sides. Smaller dead volume, large oscillating mass and high insulation are to be sought for maximizing the performances. With a pressurization of 3 bar, a theoretical useful power of 18 W can be reach with conservative modification of the existing prototype. Moreover, energy and exergy analyses highlight the main losses in the system: thermal leakage, gas spring hysteresis as well as heat transfer and viscous dissipation in the heat exchangers.

"Ac contactor is a kind of low voltage electrical appliances with large usage and wide application. Because of the frequent operation, contactor life must be long enough to ensure the reliable operation of power system. The electrical life of the contactor, as the key to affect the service life of the contactor, is mainly affected by the arc developed in the breaking and closing course. This paper concentrates on a new type of asynchronous modular contactor. To get the contactor movement characteristics, the dynamic model of the electromagnetic system is established by MATLAB/SIMULINK. Then, according to the displacement curve of contactor, the breaking process and closing process is planned. The thought of closed loop control, by adjusting the parameters of PID controller, enables the contactor to operate as the planning displacement curve. In addition, to achieve no arc or micro arc breaking and no bounce or micro bounce closing, a displacement closed loop control system for contactor is designed.

"Background: Persistent organic pollutants represent about 95 % of the industrial sector effluents in Egypt. Contamination of the River Nile water with various pesticides poses a hazardous risk to both human and environmental compartments. Therefore, a large scale monitoring study was carried on pesticides pollution in three geographical main regions along the River Nil water stream, Egypt. Methods: Organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides were extracted by liquid-liquid extraction and analyzed by GC-ECD. Results: Organochlorine pesticides mean concentrations along the River Nile water samples were 0.403, 1.081, 1.209, 3.22, and 1.192 mu g L-1 for endrin, dieldrin, p, p'-DDD, p, p'-DDT, and p, p'-DDE, respectively. Dieldrin, p, p'-DDT, and p, p'-DDE were above the standard guidelines of the World Health Organization. Detected organophosphorus pesticides were Triazophos (2.601 mu g L-1), Quinalphos (1.91 mu g L-1), fenitrothion (1.222 mu g L-1), Ethoprophos (1.076 mu g L-1), chlorpyrifos (0.578 mu g L-1), ethion (0.263 mu g L-1), Fenamiphos (0.111 mu g L-1), and pirimiphos-methyl (0.04 mu g L-1). Toxicity characterization of organophosphorus pesticides according to water quality guidelines indicated the hazardous risk of detected chemicals to the public and to the different environmental compartments. The spatial distribution patterns of detected pesticides reflected the reverse relationship between regional temperature and organochlorine pesticides distribution. However, organophosphorus was distributed according to the local inputs of pollutant compounds. Conclusions: Toxicological and water quality standards data revealed the hazardous risk of detected pesticides in the Egyptian River Nile water to human and aquatic life. Thus, our monitoring data will provide viewpoints by which stricter legislation and regulatory controls can be admitted to avoid River Nile pesticide water pollution.

"According to the EU statistics1 skin cancer - melanoma is the one of most deadly cancers. At the same time, it has up to 95% chance2 for curing if detected on the early stage. The early diagnostics is obstructed by low availability of dermatology specialists and low percentage of patients that are taking regular diagnostics. To deal with the early diagnostics unavailability we propose implementing portable automated diagnostic device, available to wide range of medical institutions. Automated diagnostic systems are not yet capable for providing final diagnosis, but are enough for detecting threats of skin cancer. Therefore, by bringing automatic tools to primary care physicians and other medical personal a lot persons could save their lives by detecting cancer on the early stage. To provide automated diagnostic tool, it is needed to solve multiple tasks including: skin images acquisition, image processing, calculating disease probability and delivering diagnosis result. These tasks have existing solutions as a commercial tool or as scientific methods, but there is a lack of ready to use service.

"At least since 1980, there has been a practically continuous, but somewhat fragmented discussion on the relevance of management research. This discussion has addressed practically all fields of management; here, besides general management, operations management, project management and construction management are examined in more detail. Although many different proposals have been made to rectify the situation, no definitive resolution has been found. In this paper, it is argued that prior analyses have not reached the root causes of the irrelevance problem. By an analysis of the recent history of management research, the following novel findings are reached. First, the root cause of the irrelevance is argued to lie in the 1959 reports on American business education, written by Pierson and Gordon & Howell. Second, while the proposed direction in the 1959 reports was deficient in several ways, the rejection of production as an integral part of organizations and management has been perhaps the most damaging feature of those reports. Third, current research on management suffers from a variety of immediate causes for irrelevance, insufficiently recognized by the scholarly community. It is suggested that reaching the root causes for irrelevance will facilitate finding suitable cures.

"A tracking controller is proposed for a crane attached to a mobile harbor (MH) equipped with a dual-stage trolley system, to dynamically position a container from the MH to the container ship or vice versa. Wave-induced motions of the MH and container ship occur during loading and unloading operations owing to external disturbances such as waves. However, a challenging task is to move a payload with unwanted swing motions accurately to the loading and unloading positions on a moving target vessel. To solve this problem, a dynamic MH crane model is derived in three-dimensional space, with roll, pitch, and heave motions caused by sea-wave disturbances. The MH crane model is then linearized to design a tracking controller and the parameters of the linearized model are obtained by carrying out the system identification process. A preview tracking control method that includes feedback and feed-forward control with the predicted target position in the x-y plane in the near future is utilized. Through numerical simulations and experiments with a scaled model, the tracking performance of the proposed dynamic positioning control system is considered when sinusoidal roll and pitch motions of the MH are generated to mimic the wavy sea environment.

"AIM To study the association between vitamin D level and hospitalization rate in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS We designed a retrospective cohort study using adult patients (>19 years) with CD followed for at least one year at our inflammatory bowel disease center. Vitamin D levels were divided into: low mean vitamin D level (< 30 ng/mL) vs appropriate mean vitamin D level (30-100 ng/mL). Generalized Poisson Regression Models (GPR) for Rate Data were used to estimate partially adjusted and fully adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) of hospitalization among CD patients. We also examined IRRs for vitamin D level as a continuous variable. RESULTS Of the 880 CD patients, 196 patients with vitamin D level during the observation period were included. Partially adjusted model demonstrated that CD patients with a low mean vitamin D level were almost twice more likely to be admitted (IRR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.38-2.24) compared to those with an appropriate vitamin D level. The fully adjusted model confirmed this association (IRR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.11-1.87). Partially adjusted model with vitamin D level as a continuous variable demonstrated, higher mean vitamin D level was associated with a 3% lower likelihood of admission with every unit (ng/mL) rise in mean vitamin D level (IRR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.96-0.98). The fully adjusted model confirmed this association (IRR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-0.99). CONCLUSION Normal or adequate vitamin D stores may be protective in the clinical course of CD. However, this role needs to be further characterized and understood.

"As solar energy costs continue to drop, the number of large-scale deployment projects increases, and the need for different analysis models for photovoltaic (PV) modules in both academia and industry rises. This paper proposes a modified equivalent-circuit model for PV modules. A PV module comprises several series-connected PV cells, to generate more electrical power, where each PV cell has an internal shunt resistance. Our proposed model simplifies the standard one-diode equivalent-circuit (SEC) model by removing the shunt resistance and including its effect on the diode part of the circuit, while retaining the original model accuracy. Our proposed equivalent circuit, called here a modified SEC (MSEC), has less number of circuit elements. All of the PV cells are assumed operating under the same ambient conditions where they share the same electric voltage and current values. To ensure the simplification did not come at a reduction in the accuracy of the SEC model, we validate our MSEC model by simulating both under the same conditions, calculate, and compare their current/voltage (I/V) characteristics. Our results validate the accuracy of our model with the difference between the two models falling below 1%. Therefore, the proposed model can be adopted as an alternative representation of the equivalent circuit for PV cells and modules.

"Aim. The authors proposed to retrospectively assess the incidence of ankle sprain and the relevant risk factors in footballers playing in the teams of the province of Parma during a professional season. Methods. Sixty-six football clubs from the province of Parma associated with the Italian Football Federation were contacted. Each athlete involved filled out a questionnaire. Results. Fifty-three athletes out of 1452 had suffered a case of ankle sprain during the professional season; 3.76% of these were amateurs, 2.1% were semi-professionals, and 18.2% were professionals. It was highlighted that in the majority of cases the ankle sprain was caused by contact during the game and that there were significant relations between the distortion and the period of the year, the number of weekly training sessions, the type of footwear worn, the characteristics of the pitch and the presence of past traumas. Discussion. The level of sports activity appears to be an important factor in injury-related risks, the resumption of the professional activity between August and October is related to a higher incidence of traumatisms. A more intense training session seems to protect from traumas, while the incidence of sprain does not appear to be related to the role of the player. Conclusion. There are different causes of ankle sprain in footballers. To reduce the incidence of these traumas it is advisable to apply adequate preventive measures on the basis of the most frequent risk factors.

"Automated compliance checking (ACC) of building designs requires automated extraction of information from building information models (BIMs). However, current industry foundation classes (IFC)-based BIMs provide limited support for ACC, because they lack the necessary information that is needed to perform compliance checking (CC). In this paper, the authors propose a new method for extending the IFC schema to incorporate CC-related information, in an objective and semiautomated manner. The method utilizes semantic natural language processing techniques and machine learning techniques to extract concepts from documents that are related to CC (e. g., building codes) and match the extracted concepts to concepts in the IFC class hierarchy. The proposed method includes a set of methods/algorithms that are combined into one computational platform: (1) a method for concept extraction that utilizes pattern-matching-based rules to extract regulatory concepts from CC-related regulatory documents; (2) a method for concept matching and semantic similarity assessment to select the most related IFC concepts to the extracted regulatory concepts; and (3) a machine learning classification method for predicting the relationship between the extracted regulatory concepts and their most related IFC concepts. The proposed method enables the extension of the IFC schema, in an objective way, using any construction regulatory document. To test and evaluate the proposed method, two chapters were randomly selected from the International Building Code (IBC) 2006 and 2009. Chapter 12 of IBC 2006 was used for training/development and Chapter 19 of IBC 2009 was used for testing and evaluation. Comparing to manually-developed gold standards, 91.7% F1-measure, 84.5% adoption rate, and 87.9% precision were achieved for regulatory concept extraction, IFC concept selection, and relationship classification, respectively.

METHODS: Mice were randomly divided into seven groups: control group, model group, three different density gypenosides monotherapy, methylprednisolone monotherapy, combination of gypenosides and methylprednisolone group. The control group was subcutaneously injected with oil emulsion adjuvant and all other groups were subcutaneously immunized with an emulsified mixture of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 3555 peptide to induce EAON. Mice in the gypenosides groups were administered injections daily with three concentrations (15 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, 45 mg/kg) of gypenosides respectively. Mice in the methylprednisolone group and the combination treatment group were injected daily with methylprednisolone (20 mg/kg) or methylprednisolone (20 mg/kg) + gypenosides (30 mg/kg), respectively. After MOG immunization, visual evoked potential (VEP), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and histopathologic examination were performed at 14, 20, 30, and 40d post-inoculation (p.i.).All results were expressed as mean +/- SEM. The data were evaluated by oneway ANOVA followed by Tukey or Games-Howell test. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, p2 latency was prolonged in the model group (P=0.041). Combination treatment can alleviated the change in VEP at 20d p.i. (P=0.012). Average peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was reduced in the model group (P= 0.000, 30d; P=0.000, 40d) and gypenosides treatment remarkably diminished the degree of RNFL degeneration at 30d and 40d p.i (P=0.000, 30d; P=0.000, 40d). The pathomorphological results showed a decrease in demyelination (P=0.020) and inflammatory reactions in the combination group compared with the model group (20d p.i.). Gypenosides treatment also alleviated the degree of axonal loss (40d p.i.) (P=0.003). CONCLUSION: Treatment with gypenosides exerts protective effects on retinal nerve fibers and axons in EAON. When combined with gypenosides, methylprednisolone reduces demyelination in the acute stage of EAON.

"A transient response model for vapor compression refrigeration system has been developed in the paper. The system model contains four sub-models representing condenser, evaporator, compressor and electronic expansion valve (EEV). The condenser and the evaporator are developed based on the moving-boundary formulation. Through linearization, these dynamic models are transformed into state-space representation which is expressed in the form of matrix. The compressor and EEV adopt steady models because their thermal inertia is much smaller compared with the heat exchangers (i.e., condenser and the evaporator). The system model has been validated by experiment in terms of step change of EEV opening degree and heat load as well as ramp increase of inlet temperature of coolant oil of condenser. The results show that the model simulations have a good agreement with the experimental data. The simulation errors compared with the experimental data are mostly less than 10%. Since the model proposed in this study is expressed in the form of state-space matrix, they are featured by strong portability and high computation efficiency. It allows us to investigate the thermal dynamic characteristics of a refrigeration system under any complicated conditions and develop excellent control schemes.

"AimDementia and cognitive impairment are important public health challenges to a rapidly aging country. The present study aimed to explore the protective factors against cognitive decline among community-dwelling middle-aged and older people from health, social, and lifestyle perspectives. MethodsData of the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study, a population-based cohort study in Taiwan, were retrieved for the study. Overall, 676 participants with intact baseline cognitive function (measured by the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire) were enrolled and followed for six years. Any increasing score of the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire in the observational period was referred to as cognitive function decline. Associated factors for cognitive decline were identified by the logistic regression model. ResultsAmong all participants, 205 (30%) experienced cognitive decline during the study period. Crude logistic regression showed that women (odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-2.6), low educational level (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4-3.0) and low mastery (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-1.9) were associated with cognitive decline, but no daily consumption of vegetables and fruits had only a marginal association (OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.9-1.8). In the fully adjusted logistic regression analysis, old age, women, low educational level and low sense of mastery were independent predictors for cognitive decline. Participants with two modifiable factors (mastery, and daily consumptions of vegetables and fruits) had a lower risk of cognitive decline (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9), compared with those without any protective factor. ConclusionsParticipants with a better educational level, better personal mastery, and more consumption of fruits and vegetables were less likely to experience cognitive decline.

"A systematic method is proposed to approach complete fault coverage for catastrophic faults in analog circuits. In the proposed method, a fault propagation graph is first created from the circuit netlist. Standard graph theory techniques are then employed to identify a minimal set of observation points (MOP) such that, by monitoring these points, complete fault coverage can be achieved, i.e., all potential catastrophic faults of the circuit can be detected theoretically. The developed method is valuable because of the increasingly critical quality requirements for modern IC applications and the lack of existing methods that can achieve sub-ppm test escapes in the state-of-the-art. A widely used benchmark circuit, a CMOS operational amplifier, is utilized to demonstrate and validate the method. Simulation results show that all catastrophic faults can be detected by monitoring the identified MOP.

"Aim: It has been hypothesised that in atopic dermatitis, the dysfunctional skin barrier facilitates the transcutaneous presentation of allergens to the immune system. This study examined whether atopic dermatitis increased the likelihood of polysensitisation, namely sensitisation to five or more allergens. Methods: We examined the electronic hospital charts of 1743 children aged 0-17 years who had visited primary or secondary care physicians with allergic symptoms, whose blood was examined for the presence of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) to the 10 most common inhaled and food allergens and whose files contained documentation of the presence of atopic dermatitis and other skin disorders. Sensitisation was defined as a specific IgE level of >= 0.35 kU/L. Results: Polysensitisation was more common in children with atopic dermatitis (268/1197, 22.4%) than those without (30/546, 5.5%, p < 0.001). This remained significant after adjustment for gender and age in a multiple logistic regression model (odds ratio: 5.63, 95% confidence interval 3.77-8.40). Other skin disorders did not show an increased risk of polysensitisation (5/97, 5.2%). Conclusion: Polysensitisation was considerably more common in children with atopic dermatitis than those without. This supports the hypothesis that sensitisation occurs through a defective skin barrier and appears to be specific for atopic dermatitis.

"Aim: To evaluate the prevalence of depression using different measures in patients with schizophrenia and to study the relationship of depression in schizophrenia with cognitive insight and clinical insight, disability and socio-occupational functioning. Methods: A total of 136 patients with schizophrenia were evaluated for depression, cognitive insight and socio-occupational functioning. Results: Of the 136 patients included in the study, one-fourth (N=34; 25%) were found to have depression as per the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). The prevalence of depression as assessed by Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS), Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS) and Depressive Subscale of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS-D) was 23.5%, 19.9% and 91.9%, respectively. Among the different scales, CDSS has highest concordance with clinician's diagnosis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for CDSS was also higher than that noted for HDRS and PANSS-D. When those with and without depression as per clinician's diagnosis were compared, those with depression were found to have significantly higher scores on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive and general psychopathology subscales, PANSS total score, participation restriction as assessed by P-scale and had lower level of functioning as assessed by Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF). No significant difference was noted on negative symptom subscale of PANSS, clinical insight as assessed on G-12 item of PANSS, disability as assessed by Indian Disability Evaluation and Assessment Scale (IDEAS) and socio-occupational functioning as assessed by Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFS). In terms of cognitive insight, those with depression had significantly higher score for both the subscales, that is, self-reflective and self-certainty subscales as well as the mean composite index score. Conclusion: Our results suggest that one-fourth of patients with schizophrenia have depression, compared to HDRS and PANSS-D, CDSS has highest concordance with clinician's diagnosis of depression and presence of depression is related to cognitive insight.

"Biogas could provide a more sustainable energy source than wood fuels for rural households in sub-Saharan African. However, functioning of biogas digesters can be limited in areas of low water availability. The water required is approximately 50dm(3)day(-1) for each cow and 10dm(3)day(-1) for each pig providing manure to the digester, or 25 (+/- 6)dm(3)day(-1) for each person in the household, using a digester volume of 1.3 (+/- 0.3)m(3) capita(-1). Here, we consider the potential of domestic water recycling, rainwater harvesting, and aquaculture to supply the water needed for digestion in different countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Domestic water recycling was found to be important in every country but was usually insufficient to meet the requirements of the digester, with households in 72% of countries need to collect additional water. Rooftop rainwater harvesting also has an important role, iron roofs being more effective than thatched roofs at collecting water. However, even with an iron roof, the size of roof commonly found in sub-Saharan Africa (15 to 40m(2)) is too small to collect sufficient water, requiring an extra area (in m(2)) for each person of (R/100) (where R is the rainfall in mm). If there is a local market for fish, stocking a pond with tilapia, fed on plankton growing on bioslurry from the digester, could provide an important source of additional income and hold the water required by the digester. In areas where rainfall is low and seasonal, the fishpond might be stocked only in the rainy season, allowing the pond to be covered during the dry period to reduce evaporation. If evaporative losses (E in mm) exceed rainfall, an extra catchment area is needed to maintain the water level in the pond, equivalent to approximately (1.5x((E-R)/R))m(2) for each person in the household.

"As video games are continuously growing in popularity and number of users, the academic community has shown an increasing interest in their potential as innovative teaching tools. Typical games contain tasks that players must complete repetitively in order to advance to later levels, yet somehow they manage to keep them constantly motivated. Enjoyable engagement is achieved by using a number of interlocking techniques; these effectively hide repetitive or complex tasks by presenting them as a series of smaller challenges embedded in a reward system. Learning occurs through the use of a seamless combination of motor and high level problem solving skills with rapid feedback. Individual problem resolution cycles range from split second decisions to hours, if not days. Matching reward systems are used to maintain player interest throughout these cycles by ensuring that there is always a new reward just out of reach, yet still obtainable with relatively minor additional effort. As a result, players are propelled through the entire experience at a pace matched to their abilities. Based on these well-tested methods from the gaming industry, educators are trying to instil the motivational power of video games to the learning process by following a practice known as ""gamification"". When used in education, gamification incorporates gaming elements to non-game processes in order to aid learning and information retention. However, its application in the classroom has been challenging, since most attempts have generally been limited to implementing points, achievement badges and leader boards to existing course material. These rewards can potentially undermine the intrinsic sense of satisfaction that engaging in creative and productive work can generate. However, when used well, game elements can reinforce intrinsic satisfaction and rewards instead of replacing them. This quasi-experimental study employed a classroom version of the TV game show ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire (R)"" to improve the delivery of an undergraduate programming course. To assess how gamification impacted the learning experience, empirical data on student satisfaction and performance from the gamified group were compared with a control group that followed traditional didactic methods. Despite the fact that the sample size was relatively small, the results were promising, showing significant increases in class attendance and final grades. Moreover, students participating in the gamified cohort considered their learning experience very engaging and motivating, thus encouraging the adoption of this technique in other courses.

Therefore, it is imperative to adopt appropriate rainwater harvesting and reuse technique(s) by promoting soil and water management research to sustain crop productivity. Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) is a primary stable crop of Sudan. Extensive field experiments were conducted to study the effect of water harvesting techniques (WHTs) and supplemental irrigation (SI) on infiltration rate (IR), soil moisture content (SMC), growth and productivity of sorghum during two rainy seasons (2012 and 2013). RESULTSThe results showed that the WHTs and SI affected the soil physical properties, growth and productivity parameters of sorghum. The results indicated that the tied-ridging with SI (TRwSI) produced the highest values of accumulative IR, SMC and sorghum productivity (115mm, 13% and 4000kgh(-1), in season 2012, respectively, whereas in season 2013 the values were 145mm, 10% and 5000kgh(-1), for accumulative IR, SMC and sorghum productivity, respectively. Basin with SI (BwSI) ranked second, next to TRwSI in the both seasons. CONCLUSIONHence, water harvesting and SI are expected to play a significant role in terms of sustainable agricultural and socio-economic development in western Sudan and similar areas.

"Aim: A proof-of-concept study to explore whether DNA methylation at first diagnosis is associated with response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients & methods: DNA methylation was quantified in T-lymphocytes from 46 treatment-naive patients using HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Treatment response was determined in 6 months using the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria. Results: Initial filtering identified 21 cytosine-phosphate-guanines (CpGs) that were differentially methylated between responders and nonresponders. After conservative adjustment for multiple testing, six sites remained statistically significant, of which four showed high sensitivity and/or specificity (>= 75%) for response to treatment. Moreover, methylation at two sites in combination was the strongest factor associated with response (80.0% sensitivity, 90.9% specificity, AUC 0.85). Conclusion: DNA methylation at diagnosis is associated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drug treatment response in early RA.

"Aim. The present study investigates the evolution of illicit drug use among Romanian university students from 1999 to 2011. Methods. The study was performed in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, in three phases: in 1999 (T1), in 2003 (T2) and in 2011 (T3). The study was carried out by means of anonymous questionnaires among university students aged 19-24. Results. The results show that among girls the lifetime illicit drugs use increased statistically significantly from 2.5% in 1999 to 7.5% in 2003 and to 15% in 2011. Among boys the trend was also increasing, the prevalence of illicit drug use was 14.2% at T1, 18.1% at T2, and it increased dramatically to 30.6% at T3. The percentage of students reporting cannabis use was almost identical with the total prevalence of illicit drug use. Ecstasy was the second most frequent drug used by the students; its consumption had also an increasing trend during the examined periods (from 0 to 5.6% among girls and from 0.8% to 11.2% among boys). The results of the bivariate correlation analyses show that lifetime illicit drug use was associated with having friends who experimented with illicit drugs both among boys and girls. Moreover, girls who declared stress management problems and depressive episodes were more likely to try illicit drugs, while among boys illicit drug use was associated with poorer academic performance. Conclusions. The data pointed out by our study call for comprehensive actions regarding the prevention of illicit drug use among Romanian young people.

"Background: The ultimate ambient-intelligent care room contains numerous sensors and devices to monitor the patient, sense and adjust the environment and support the staff. This sensor-based approach results in a large amount of data, which can be processed by current and future applications, e. g., task management and alerting systems. Today, nurses are responsible for coordinating all these applications and supplied information, which reduces the added value and slows down the adoption rate. The aim of the presented research is the design of a pervasive and scalable framework that is able to optimize continuous care processes by intelligently reasoning on the large amount of heterogeneous care data. Methods: The developed Ontology-based Care Platform (OCarePlatform) consists of modular components that perform a specific reasoning task. Consequently, they can easily be replicated and distributed. Complex reasoning is achieved by combining the results of different components. To ensure that the components only receive information, which is of interest to them at that time, they are able to dynamically generate and register filter rules with a Semantic Communication Bus (SCB). This SCB semantically filters all the heterogeneous care data according to the registered rules by using a continuous care ontology. The SCB can be distributed and a cache can be employed to ensure scalability. Results: A prototype implementation is presented consisting of a new-generation nurse call system supported by a localization and a home automation component. The amount of data that is filtered and the performance of the SCB are evaluated by testing the prototype in a living lab. The delay introduced by processing the filter rules is negligible when 10 or fewer rules are registered. Conclusions: The OCarePlatform allows disseminating relevant care data for the different applications and additionally supports composing complex applications from a set of smaller independent components. This way, the platform significantly reduces the amount of information that needs to be processed by the nurses. The delay resulting from processing the filter rules is linear in the amount of rules. Distributed deployment of the SCB and using a cache allows further improvement of these performance results.

"As one of the most important tasks in computer vision, online object tracking plays a critical role in numerous lines of research, which has drawn a lot of researchers' attention and be of many realistic applications. This paper develops a novel tracking algorithm based on the bag-of-local-patches representation with the discriminative learning scheme. In the first frame, a codebook is learned by applying the Kmeans algorithm to a set of densely sampled local patches of the tracked object, and then used to represent the template and candidate samples. During the tracking process, the similarities between the coding coefficients of the candidates and template are chosen as the likelihood values of these candidates. In addition, we propose effective model updating and discriminative learning schemes to capture the appearance change of the tracked object and incorporate the discriminative information to achieve a robust matching. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on some challenging image sequences demonstrate that the proposed tracker performs better than other state-of-the-art tracking methods.

"Aim: It has been reported that a great proportion of mental health disorders have an origin in early childhood. In order to evaluate factors possibly associated with children's health, the health monitoring units have been established since 2004 in six study regions in Bavaria, Germany. The second health monitoring survey, implemented in 2005-06, focuses on the mental health status of preschool children. The goal of this study is (1) to examine the association of sociodemographic and environmental factors with mental health and (2) to analyze the applicability of the results of the health monitoring units to all preschool children in Bavaria by calculating weighting factors. Methods: Data on 6206 preschool children are available. Logistic regression analysis is applied to analyze possible associations with mental health. A weighting method is applied to correct for deviances compared to the whole population of preschool children in Bavaria (N =132,783). Results: 11% of preschool children show mental health problems. Regarding different indicators of sociodemographic status, low household income [unadjusted OR 3.34, 95% CI: 2.23-4.98] shows the strongest association of mental health problems. Non-accessibility of green space [unadjusted OR 2.74, 95% CI: 1.87-4.00] is also strongly associated with mental health. The results of the unweighted and weighted analysis are similar. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that sociodemographic status and factors in the living environment show associations with mental health of children. Based on the results of the unweighted and weighted analyses, the second health monitoring analysis shows little deviances compared to data of all Bavarian preschool children. Therefore, the results can be compared to all Bavarian preschool children. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

"Absolutely secure communication should be implemented only through the 'one-time pad' proposed by Shannon, requires that physical random numbers with rates matched with the associated communication systems be used as secret keys. With the wide application of the WDM technology in optical communication, the single channel rate of the current digital communication system has exceeded 10 Gb/s and developed towards 100 Gb/s. To ensure the absolute security of such a large capacity communication, a large number of real-time, and secure random numbers are needed. Secure random numbers are commonly produced through utilizing physical random phenomena, called physical random number generators. However, conventional physical random number generators are limited by the low bandwidth of the applied entropy sources such as thermal noise, photon-counting and chaotic electrical circuits, and thus have typical low bit rates of the order of Mb/s. In recent years, chaotic lasers attracted wide attention due to their generation of secure, reliable and high-speed random number sequences, and so due to their coherent merits such as high bandwidth, large amplitude fluctuation and ease of integration. There have been lots of schemes based on laser chaos for high-speed random number generation, but most of them execute the random number extractions from the associated laser chaos in the electrical domain and thus their generation rates are faced with the well-known 'electrical bottleneck'. On the other hand, all-optical random number generation (AO-RNG) methods are all signal processes in the optical domain, so they can efficiently overcome this rate limitation and have a great potential in generating ultrafast random numbers of several dozens or hundreds of Gb/s. However, there is no experimental report on its realization of AO-RNG. One of the obstacles in the way for the AO-RNG achievement is to implement the fast and real-time all-optical sampling of the entropy signals (i.e., laser chaos). In this paper, we present a principal experimental demonstration of the feasibility in the all-optical sampling of the chaotic light signal through constructing a TOAD-based all-optical sampler with a polarization-independent semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA). Specifically, we experimentally generate chaotic laser signals using an optical feedback semiconductor laser and finally complete a 5 GSa/s real-time and high-fidelity all-optical sampling of the chaotic laser with a bandwidth of 6.4 GHz. Further experimental results show that whether the optical sampling period is proportional to the external cavity feedback time or not has a great effect on the weak periodic suppression of the chaotic signal: only when both of them are out of proportion, can the weak periodicity of the original chaotic signal be effectively eliminated; and this is favorable for the generation of high-quality physical random numbers. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to realize all-optical sampling of chaotic signal in experiments.

"BIM (building information modelling) has developed into a powerful solution that can improve many aspects of construction industry. Current research regarding the impact of orientation on a building's energy needs seldom tap into the potential of BIM. This study investigates the impact of orientation on energy consumption in small-scale construction, and assesses how BIM can be used to facilitate this process. The methods adopted are three-fold. Firstly, a real-life building is modelled using Revit, one of the leading BIM tools. Secondly, through green building Extensible Markup Language, the model is exported to Green Building Studio, one of the leading energy simulation software. Thirdly, in the Green Building Studio, different building orientations are adopted and their impacts of the whole building energy are investigated. Based on the analysis of the energy consumption corresponding to the different orientations, it emerged that a well-orientated building can save a considerable amount of energy throughout its life cycle. Specifically, a total electricity use difference of 17 056 kWh and a total gas use difference of 27 988 MJ leading to a combined energy cost savings of 878 pound throughout a 30 year period between the best (+180 degrees) and worst (+45 degrees) orientations of the building was achieved.

"Assistive Technologies (AT) are an application area where several Artificial Intelligence techniques and tools have been successfully applied to support elderly or impeded people on their daily activities. However, approaches to AT tend to center in the user-tool interaction, neglecting the user's connection with its social environment (such as caretakers, relatives and health professionals) and the possibility to monitor undesired behaviour providing both adaptation to a dynamic environment and early response to potentially dangerous situations. In previous work we have presented COAALAS, an intelligent social and norm-aware device for elderly people that is able to autonomously organize, reorganize and interact with the different actors involved in elderly-care, either human actors or other devices.

"AimBy investigating the association of urodynamics and urogenital nerve growth factor (NGF) levels in vaginal mesh surgery, we may be able to associate the likelihood of postoperative lower urinary tract symptoms developing as a result of synthetic mesh implanted for pelvic floor reconstructive surgery. MethodsThirty-eight female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: mesh, sham (no mesh), and control. Urodynamic study and NGF analysis of the urogenital tissues were done and results were compared among all groups. The urodynamic studies of the mesh and sham groups were further divided into the 4th and 10th days. A P-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant. ResultsAll rats survived and no complications were observed during the post-implantation period. Histological evaluation showed intense acute inflammatory reaction on days 4 and 7 in the mesh and sham groups when compared to the control. The mesh group showed a larger area of inflammation as compared to the sham. The NGF levels increased significantly in the mesh and sham groups on the 4th and 10th days when compared to the control (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). Both the mesh and sham groups had shorter voiding interval and lower voiding volume on days 4 and 10 when compared to the control group (P<0.001, P<0.001, respectively). The magnitude on increasing NGF level and decreasing voiding interval and voiding volume was significantly more on the mesh group than the sham group. ConclusionA higher level of NGF in the early days post-transvaginal mesh implantation is associated with a shorter voiding interval and a smaller bladder capacity, which represents abnormal lower urinary tract symptoms following transvaginal mesh implantation.

"Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are communities of cyanobacteria, algae, microfungi, lichens and bryophytes in varying proportions, which live within or immediately on top of the uppermost millimeters of the soil in arid and semiarid regions. As biocrusts are highly relevant for ecosystem processes like carbon, nitrogen, and water cycling, a correct characterization of their spatial distribution is required. Following this objective, considerable efforts have been devoted to the identification and mapping of biocrusts using remote sensing data, and several mapping indices have been developed. However, their transferability to different regions has only rarely been tested. In this study we investigated the transferability of two multispectral indices, i.e. the Crust Index (CI) and the Biological Soil Crust Index (BSCI), and two hyperspectral indices, i.e. the Continuum Removal Crust Identification Algorithm (CRCIA) and the Crust Development Index (CDI), in three sites dominated by biocrusts, but with differences in soil and vegetation composition. Whereas multispectral indices have been important and valuable tools for first approaches to map and classify biological soil crusts, hyperspectral data and indices developed for these allowed to classify biocrusts at much higher accuracy. While multispectral indices showed Kappa (kappa) values below 0.6, hyperspectral indices obtained good classification accuracy (kappa similar to 0.8) in both the study area where they had been developed and in the newly tested region. These results highlight the capability of hyperspectral sensors to identify specific absorption features related to photosynthetic pigments as chlorophyll and carotenoids, but also the limitation of multispectral information to discriminate between areas dominated by biocrusts, vegetation or bare soil. Based on these results we conclude that remote sensing offers an important and valid tool to map biocrusts. However, the spectral similarity between the main surface components of drylands and biocrusts demand for mapping indices based on hyperspectral information to correctly map areas dominated by biocrusts at ecosystem scale.

"A study is presented to determine if substituting an internal combustion engine (ICE) by an electric motor powered by a fuel cell stack can be a viable option to increase the service ceiling of an available light unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), extending it to 10,000 m. As a first condition, the stack has to be capable of supplying the minimum power required for horizontal leveled flight at this altitude, which is a function of the UAV total mass. A second step examines if the UAV can transport the energy required to reach the desired service ceiling without exceeding the maximum mass that can be loaded, considering that both hydrogen and oxygen have to be carried on-board. A particularly light PEM fuel cell stack is proposed as a suitable power source. A realistic system is described to store the required amount of reactant gases maintaining the mass below the allowable limits. Results indicate that with its aerodynamic characteristics, the UAV should be capable of ascending up to 10,000 m with the described fuel cell and gas storage system. Some multivariable maps that include service ceiling, total payload and required power are provided to perform this type of analysis. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

"A system for measuring the dielectric propel-ties of cereal grains from 1 to 350 MHz with a coaxial sample holder is presented. Several polar alcohols were used to calibrate and verify permittivity measurements obtained with a signal-flow graph model from the full two-part S-parameter measurements. At the lowest frequencies (1-25 MHz), where the phase measurements are less accurate, a lumped parameter model was used for the dielectric loss factor measurements. The system was calibrated with measurements on air and decanol and verified with measurements on octanol, hexanol, and pentanol. The standard error for the polar alcohols used for verification was 2.3% for the dielectric constant and 7.6% for the dielectric loss factor. Although measurements were taken on static samples, the sample holder is designed to accommodate flowing grain. Dielectric properties measurements at 25 degrees C were taken on four hard red winter wheat cultivars ranging in moisture content from about 9% to 21% with bulk densities varying from 0.66 to 0.83 g/cm(3). Most of the data agreed with measurements reported in the literature.

"Availability of long term solar data and the quality of available data is usually an obstacle to the development of proposals for new concentrating solar power plants. Typical or representative meteorological years using hourly solar and weather data that has been selected to match long-term averages are often used to perform the preliminary design and performance assessment of solar power plants. Although the use of this data is convenient due to the reduced computational requirements in plant optimization, it may result in a simplistic prediction of plant operations that does not reflect the real plant performance by neglecting the impact of short-term variability in solar irradiance and the variations in weather and available solar energy for different years. This study conducts a systematic analysis of the influence of multi-year data sets with a range of different time step sizes (5,15, 30 and 60 min) and thermal storage capacities (4, 8 and 12 h) using the physical parabolic trough with molten salt storage model in NREL's System Advisor Model. Results indicate that the appropriateness of different step sizes is likely to vary depending on the purpose of the modelling; however, sensitivity to step size is reduced for larger storage capacities.

"Background: Alcohol ingestion influences sensory-motor function and the overall well-being of individuals. Detecting alcohol induced impairments in gait in daily life necessitates a continuous and unobtrusive gait monitoring system. Objectives: This paper introduces the development and use of a non-intrusive monitoring system to detect changes in gait induced by alcohol intoxication. Methods: The proposed system employed a pair of sensorized smart shoes that are equipped with pressure sensors on the insole. Gait features were extracted and adjusted based on individual's gait profile. The adjusted gait features were used to train a machine learning classifier to discriminate alcohol-impaired gait from normal walking. In experiment of pilot study, twenty participants completed walking trials on a 12 meter walkway to measure their sober walking and alcohol-impaired walking using smart shoes. Results: The proposed system can detect alcohol-impaired gait with an accuracy of 86.2% when pressure value analysis and person-dependent model for the classifier are applied, while statistical analysis revealed that no single feature was discriminative for the detection of gait impairment. Conclusions: Alcohol-induced gait disturbances can be detected with smart shoe technology for an automated monitoring in ubiquitous environment. We demonstrated that personal monitoring and machine learning-based prediction could be customized to detect individual variation rather than applying uniform boundary parameters of gait.

"Active filters are effective solutions to eliminating harmonic pollution and improving reactive power in the presence of nonlinear loads and unbalanced sources. To reduce the disturbances caused by this type of load, we propose, in this paper, a new control strategy of a shunt active filter. Our method aims to improve electrical quantity behavior in steady and dynamic states, while reducing the installing cost of the filter, through eliminating AC line voltage sensors. This is established by Direct Power Control (DPC), based on Virtual Flux (VF) estimation of the electrical network, using a switching function table. Facing disturbances affecting the electrical network, we have integrated a Phase Locked Loop (PLL), and have implemented and tested our new control strategy in a Matlab/Simulink environment. The results obtained show the effectiveness of the active filter control algorithm in eliminating harmonic currents, and shows an improvement in the reactive power injected from nonlinear loads, which has allowed us to confirm the robustness of the proposed strategy.

"Bioretention cells (BRCs) are an increasingly popular Stormwater Control Measure used to mitigate the hydrologic and water quality impacts of urbanization. Previous BRC research has demonstrated a strong capacity for pollutant removal; however, long-term sequestration of pollutants within soil media can elevate concentrations to levels fostering environmental and human health risks. Soil media samples were collected from an 11 year-old BRC in Charlotte, NC, and analyzed for the accumulation and spatial distribution of zinc, copper, and phosphorus. Pollutant distribution varied significantly with respect to depth and ordinate distance from the BRC inlet. Zinc concentrations (0.9-228.6 mg kg(-1) soil) exceeded environmental thresholds and phosphorus concentrations (5.1-173.3 mg kg(-1) soil) increased from initial levels by a factor of seven; however, notable accumulation was restricted to the BRC forebay. Maximum zinc and copper concentrations in soil media did not exceed 1% of mandatory cleanup levels and with regular maintenance of the forebay, the effective life of BRC media should exceed the life of the developments they treat.

"As non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies are expected to replace DRAM in the near future, new challenges have emerged. For example, NVMs have slow and power-consuming writes, and limited write endurance. In addition, NVMs have a data remanence vulnerability, i.e., they retain data for a long time after being powered off. NVM encryption alleviates the vulnerability, but exacerbates the limited endurance by increasing the number of writes to memory. We observe that, in current systems, a large percentage of main memory writes result from data shredding in operating systems, a process of zeroing out physical pages before mapping them to new processes, in order to protect previous processes' data. In this paper, we propose Silent Shredder, which repurposes initialization vectors used in standard counter mode encryption to completely eliminate the data shredding writes. Silent Shredder also speeds up reading shredded cache lines, and hence reduces power consumption and improves overall performance. To evaluate our design, we run three PowerGraph applications and 26 multiprogrammed workloads from the SPEC 2006 suite, on a gem5-based full system simulator. Silent Shredder eliminates an average of 48.6% of the writes in the initialization and graph construction phases. It speeds up main memory reads by 3.3 times, and improves the number of instructions per cycle (IPC) by 6.4% on average. Finally, we discuss several use cases, including virtual machines' data isolation and user-level large data initialization, where Silent Shredder can be used effectively at no extra cost.

"Aim: To investigate the analgesic efficacy and safety of combined therapy using drotaverine and ketorolac vs ketorolac in the treatment of acute renal colic. Methods: This was a retrospective study of a consecutive cohort that included 322 emergency department (ED) patients with a diagnosis of renal colic from our hospital, from June 2014 to September 2015. Pain intensity (PI) was recorded using a visual analog scale (VAS) at different time-points after treatment. The primary outcome was defined as a decrease of 50% or more in the mean PI. The need for rescue analgesics in 120 min and occurrence of adverse effects were considered as secondary outcomes. Results: Of 322 eligible patients, 249 patients were analyzed in this study: 125 patients received ketorolac plus drotaverine and 124 patients received ketorolac only. There were significant differences in PI between the two groups at 30min and 120 min (PI: [OR 1.573, 95% Cl: 1.007-3.054, P-30 min = 0.047], [OR 2.938, 95% Cl: 1.11-7.78, P-120 min = 0.03] in multivariable logistic regression) (PI: [OR 1.869, 95% Cl: 1.119-3.121, P-30 min = 0.017], [OR 2.938, 95% Cl: 1.117.78, P-120 min = 0.03] in univariable logistic regression). Moreover, significant differences were also found in PI in subgroup analysis of patients with mid and proximal ureteric stones (PI: [OR 3.888, 95% Cl: 1.409-10.729, P-30 min = 0.009] in multivariable logistic regression) (PI: [OR 3.476, 95% Cl: 1.363-8.865, P-30 min = 0.009] in univariable logistic regression). Pain relief at 120 min was obtained in 119 patients (95.2%) receiving combined therapy and in 106 patients (85.5%) receiving ketorolac (P = 0.011). Rescue analgesics were required in six patients (4.8%) receiving combined therapy and 18 patients (14.5%) receiving ketorolac (P = 0.009). Adverse events were similar between the two groups: 20 (16%) in the combined group and 16 (13%) in the ketorolac group (P = 0.843). Conclusion: Ketorolac combined with drotaverine is effective in relief of acute renal colic, especially pain due to mid and proximal ureteric lithiasis, but did not decrease PI significantly in renal colic patients with renal and distal ureteral stones. On the other hand, combined therapy with ketorolac and drotaverine was associated with a reduced use of rescue analgesics.

"A verification methodology is described and evaluated to formally determine uncertain linear systems stability in digital controllers with considerations to the implementation aspects. In particular, this methodology is combined with the digital-system verifier (DSVerifier), which is a verification tool that employs Bounded Model Checking based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories to check the stability of digital control systems with uncertainty. DSVerifier determines the control system stability, considering all the plant interval variation set, together with the Finite Word-length (FWL) effects in the digital controller implementation; DSVerifier checks the robust non-fragile stability of a given closed-loop system. The proposed methodology and respective tool are evaluated considering non-fragile control examples from literature. Experimental results show that the approach used in this study is able to foresee fragility problems in robust controllers, which could be overlooked by other existing approaches due to underestimating of FWL effects.

"Aim: The Danish National Chronic Myeloid Neoplasia Registry (DCMR) is a population-based clinical quality database, introduced to evaluate diagnosis and treatment of patients with chronic myeloid malignancies. The aim is to monitor the clinical quality at the national, regional, and hospital departmental levels and serve as a platform for research. Study population: The DCMR has nationwide coverage and contains information on patients diagnosed at hematology departments from January 2010 onward, including patients with essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, myelofibrosis, unclassifiable myeloproliferative neoplasms, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia. Main variables: Data are collected using standardized registration forms (so far up to four forms per patient), which are consecutively filled out online at time of diagnosis, after 2-year and 5-year follow-ups, and at end of follow-up. The forms include variables that describe clinical/paraclinical assessments, treatment, disease progression, and survival - disease-specific variables - as well as variables that are identical for all chronic myeloid malignancies. Descriptive data: By the end of 2014, the DCMR contained data on 2,690 patients with an inclusion rate of similar to 500 patients each year. Since the registry was established, annual reports have shown consistently high national coverage and data completeness, >= 90% and >= 88%, respectively. Conclusion: The DCMR is a national database used for monitoring the quality of patient care in patients with chronic myeloid malignancies, but until validation has been conducted, the data must be used with caution. However, the DCMR is a valuable data source accessible to clinicians and researchers.

"Aims and objectives. To evaluate caregiver burden and factors that influence this burden among caregivers and patients with Alzheimer's disease in China. Background. Long-term care can reduce the quality of life for caregivers and result in both mental and physical exhaustion. However, little is known about caregiver burden and associated factors in China. Design. The study had a quantitative cross-sectional design. Methods. A total of 309 caregivers and their patients were included in the study. The patients' cognitive, psychological and functional status and their caregivers' burden, sleep quality and mental state were evaluated. Descriptive analyses, single-factor regression and stepwise factor regression were used to determine the effects of various factors on caregiver burden. Results. Older females and spouses still play an important role in providing family care for those with dementia. Most of the caregivers were the sole full-time caregiver and had little time for themselves. Sleepiness was a common physical problem for caregivers, and some of them had moderate to severe depression and anxiety. A lower functional status of the patient was associated with higher caregiver burden. Poorer physical status compared with before caregiving began, lower life satisfaction, and higher degrees of depression and anxiety were associated with higher caregiver burden. Conclusion. Depression, anxiety and sleep problems are the main challenges that are faced by family caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Caregivers' functional status, lower life satisfaction, depression and anxiety influenced caregiver burden. Caregiver burden was related to the severity of the patient's dementia and the personal factors of the caregivers. Relevance to clinical practice. To provide information about caregivers' current status while caring for patients with Alzheimer's disease and to understand caregiver burden and its related factors. Professionals who work with Alzheimer's disease should pay more attention to caregiver burden, especially those with mental and physical problems.

"Aims and objectives. To explore and describe how young adults between 18-25 years of age experienced growing up with a parent with multiple sclerosis and how these experiences continue to influence their daily lives. Background. Chronic parental illness is occurring in about 10% of families worldwide, but little is known about how the children experience growing up with a parent with multiple sclerosis during their childhood and into young adulthood. Design. We chose a qualitative design using a phenomenological approach based on Giorgi. Methods. Exploratory and open-ended interviews with 14 young adults were conducted. Results. The essence of the phenomenon of having a parent with multiple sclerosis was synthesized into 'Striving for balance between caring and restraint' from two themes 'caring' and 'restraint' and eight subthemes. Participants' experiences of caring for parents with multiple sclerosis continued influencing their other close relationships, in which they tended to assume responsibility while concealing some of their feelings and desires. Most participants showed restraint among parents with and without multiple sclerosis, friends and partners. Conclusion. It seems that one of the greatest challenges of having a parent with multiple sclerosis is achieving a balance between caring for others and asserting one's own desires. Relevance to clinical practice. Healthcare professionals can support the family by encouraging family members to participate in consultations and to assist the parents in providing information about multiple sclerosis and its symptoms to the children. Parents might need assistance in applying for help with domestic chores or referrals to support groups for their children or other family members.

"AimRapid pacing (RP) is a regularly used model to induce heart failure in dogs. The aim of the study was to evaluate Ca2+ handling, left ventricular (LV) contractile response during Ca2+ administration compared to exercise, as well as oxygen consumption and mechanical efficiency after 48h of RP. MethodsFifty-three mongrel dogs were instrumented to measure LV pressure, LV fractional shortening, regional wall thickening and coronary blood flow. Contractile reserve was measured with isoproterenol and intravenous (IV) Ca2+ administration. To assess the function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), post-extrasystolic potentiation (PESP) and SR Ca2+ uptake were measured. A graded treadmill test was performed in baseline and after RP (n=14). In a separate group of animals (n=5), myocardial performance and oxygen consumption were measured using a wide range of loading conditions. ResultsLeft ventricular contractility was significantly decreased upon cessation of pacing. The contractile response to isoproterenol was blunted compared to a preserved response to IV Ca2+. Post-extrasystolic potentiation was slightly increased after RP. Maximal velocity (V-max) of SR Ca2+ uptake was unchanged. Contractile response during exercise is attenuated after RP. External work is reduced, whereas oxygen consumption is preserved, provoking a reduced mechanical efficiency. ConclusionForty-eight-hours RP provokes a reversible LV dysfunction, while the SR function and response to exogenous Ca2+ are preserved. This is compatible with an intracellular functional remodelling to counteract Ca2+ overload provoked by RP. Left ventricular dysfunction is accompanied by a reduced contractile reserve, but an unchanged oxygen consumption, illustrating an alteration in oxygen utilization.

"Background: China's rapid urbanization over the past decades has exacerbated the problems of environmental degradation and health disparities. However, few studies have analysed the differences between urban and rural residents in relation to how environmental quality impacts health outcomes. This study examines the associations between Chinese people's perceptions of environmental quality and their self-rated health, particularly focusing on differences between rural and urban residents in environment-health relationships. Methods: Using a logistic regression model and data from the 2013 Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS), a representative sample of data for 3,402 urban residents (46 +/- 16 years) and 2,439 rural residents (48 +/- 15 years) was analysed. The dependent variable used for the logistic regressions was whether or not respondents reported being healthy. Independent variables included respondents' evaluations of the living environment, and how frequently they participated in physical activities. Interaction terms were employed to measure the moderating effects of physical exercise on the relationship between perceived environmental quality and health. Results: The percentage of healthy urban residents was significantly larger than that of healthy rural respondents (70.87% versus 62.87%). Urban respondents living in areas with sufficient green space were more likely to report good health (OR = 0.749, CI = [0.628, 0.895]), while rural respondents without reliable access to fresh water were more likely to report poor health (OR = 0.762, CI = [0.612, 0.949]). Urban respondents who were exposed to green spaces and exercised frequently were 21.6 per cent more likely to report good health than those who exercised infrequently (OR = 1.216, CI = [1.047, 1.413]). Those who lived in areas with insufficient green space and exercised frequently were 19.1 per cent less likely to report good health than those who exercised infrequently (OR = 0.805, CI = [0.469, 1.381]). No evidence suggested that physical exercise exerted a moderating effect on the relationship between exposure to air pollution and health. Conclusions: On average, urban residents have better health than rural residents. Among four indicators for low environmental quality (air pollution, lack of green spaces, water pollution, uncertain access to freshwater resources), green space was an important determinant of urban residents' health status, while unreliable access to fresh water harmed rural residents' health. Physical exercise moderated the effects of exposure to green spaces on urban residents' health.

"As recent heterogeneous system designs integrate general purpose processors, GPUs, and other specialized accelerator devices into a single platform to provide both power and performance benefits, it is important to support efficient dispatching mechanisms in terms of performance and programmability. This work proposes models for integrating hardware accelerators with applications executing under standard operating systems on an embedded processor. Instead of using direct mapping of accelerator units to user applications, or using legacy drivers that incur communication overheads and large programming effort, we develop an abstraction layer in kernel driver which driver communicates with a custom dispatcher to interface a number of hardware accelerators. At the same time we remove the need to include IOMMUs for virtual-to-physical translation from the device side, and the need to perform copies from user to kernel space when offtoading computational instensive tasks to the accelerators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions running real applications on a prototype hybrid heterogeneous System-on-Chip platform.

"ArchiveDB is the data archive for all scientific and technical data collected at the Wendelstein 7-X project. It is a distributed system allowing continuous data archival. ArchiveDB has demanding requirements regarding performance efficiency (storage performance of 30 GB/s during experiments, expected storage amount of 1.4 PB/year), reliability (availability of 364 days/year), maintainability (testability) and portability (including change of hardware and software). Data acquisition with continuous operation and high time resolutions (up to nanoseconds scale) for physics data is supported as well as long-term recording up to 24 h/7 days for operational data (similar to 1 Hz rate). Moreover, all results of data analysis are stored in the archive. Another challenge, uniform retrieval of measured and analyzed data, allowing time and structure information as selection criteria, is mastered as well. The key concepts of data storage and retrieval are: (1) partitioning of incoming data in groups and stream, (2) chunking of data in boxes of manageable size covering a finite time period, and (3) indexing of data using absolute time as ordering and indexing criteria. Continuous operation of the ArchiveDB software and hardware for various systems and components relevant to Wendelstein 7-X has been done successfully for several years, thus, showing that the key requirements are satisfied. The overall data amount so far has reached 7 Terabyte over 9 years of data taking. Round-the-clock operation of the archive is in place since 5 years. Initial plasma operation OP1.1 of Wendelstein 7-X has been supported with no downtime during the whole experimental campaign. The paper describes the software engineering concepts that have been used, consolidated and refined over the years of continuing productive ArchiveDB use and development.

"As a result of the application of a technique of multistep processes stochastic models construction the range of models, implemented as a self-consistent differential equations, was obtained. These are partial differential equations (master equation, the Fokker-Planck equation) and stochastic differential equations (Langevin equation). However, analytical methods do not always allow to research these equations adequately. It is proposed to use the combined analytical and numerical approach studying these equations. For this purpose the numerical part is realized within the framework of symbolic computation. It is recommended to apply stochastic Runge-Kutta methods for numerical study of stochastic differential equations in the form of the Langevin. Under this approach, a program complex on the basis of analytical calculations metasystem Sage is developed. For model verification logarithmic walks and Black-Scholes two-dimensional model are used. To illustrate the stochastic ""predator-prey"" type model is used. The utility of the combined numerical-analytical approach is demonstrated.

"As distributed generators in distribution networks have brought much influence to the fault current, the traditional fault-section locating algorithm of distribution networks may not work. In this paper, a new switching function is built which can be used in the distribution network with single power supply and multi power supplies. A regional processing method is used in this paper, which divides the distribution network into several independent regions, then the fault locating algorithm is used in these independent regions. The regions without DG connection are eliminated if fault current is not detected. So the complexity of computation of fault-section location is reduced. Ant colony algorithm is a good optimization algorithm of swarm intelligence. Because of its positive feedback, fault tolerance and distributed computing features, good application effect of locating faulty section in distribution network can be attained. In order to overcome the disadvantages such as large amounts of calculation, long searching time, local optimal. Ant colony algorithm is improved by adaptive dynamic modifying pheromone. Ant system with elitist strategy and MMAS are also used in this paper. This improved algorithm is used in distribution network with multi distributed generators.

"Aim: The aim of this study was to clarify the rates of remission and progression for microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM); and factors associated with remission and progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Patients and Methods: T2DM patients with a urinary albumin excretion (UAE) rate of 30-300 mg/gCr who were attending the medical clinic in the Tsugaru region in Japan were enrolled into this prospective, observational study for 36 months (N= 317). We investigated the rate of remission (UAE= 300 mg/gCr; overt proteinuria) 36 months after study registration. Results: The number of patients whose UAE levels were= 300 mg/gCr (DN progression) at 36 months after registration was 32 (13.7%). From multiple logistic regression analysis, the sole factor that contributed to remission at 36 months after registration was the UAE levels at registration (OR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.98-1.00, p=0.003), and the factors that contributed to progression at 36 months after registration were the levels of UAE (OR: 1.01; 95% CI: 1.01-1.02, p=0.000) and systolic blood pressure (OR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93-1.00, p=0.033) at registration. Conclusion: Results suggest that patients with less severe microalbuminuria among microalbuminuric patients might more commonly experience DN remission and that earlier intervention is very important for promoting microalbuminuria remission in DN.

"Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technology will enable next generation radars achieve better jamming resistance capability and low probability of intercept by spreading their emissions over a wide frequency range. These radars systems consist of a large number of transmit/receive modules (TRMs) which are electronically scanned in a tight time-synchronized manner. This requires digital control to move closer to the radio front end on the antennas. Other emerging technologies, such as cognitive radars and MIMO radars, will continue to drive the need for complex timing, synchronization, and high mix RF and digital measurement requirements. To meet these challenges, radar engineers will need a platform based approach which delivers capabilities such as multi-channel phase aligned measurements over wide bandwidths and high-throughput streaming. This paper discusses the fundamentals of AESA radars and trends in radar systems. It analyzes the impact of these trends on test system architecture and explains how the advances in PXI modular instrumentation can meet these challenging requirements.

"As part of curriculum changes in South Africa, an introductory programming language, Scratch, must first be taught before switching to the well-established teaching of Delphi. The nature of programming in Scratch is considerably different from that in Delphi. It was assumed that the teaching of Scratch as introductory programming language could support learners' understanding of Delphi. Teachers did not receive much training in Scratch. This study explores teachers' experiences of their first year of the teaching of Scratch. The purpose of the research was to understand how Scratch can be used effectively as a transitioning language to Delphi and to deduce guidelines for teaching Scratch as introduction to object-oriented programming in Delphi. A qualitative research method, within the interpretive paradigm, was selected for this research. Interviews were done with eight randomly selected Information Technology (IT) teachers in the province of North-West, South Africa to gain insight into their experiences of teaching Scratch in 2012, the first year of implementing the new curriculum. Findings show that teachers were uncertain how to teach programming concepts and how to integrate problem solving and algorithm design into teaching Scratch. The focus of teaching was on Scratch, instead of on teaching programming concepts with Scratch. Emerging guidelines emphasise the integration of problem solving and algorithm design; the creation of opportunities to expose learners to error handling and program testing; and the inculcatation of programming concepts. We furthermore recommend active teaching-learning strategies such as pair programming.

"Appropriately merging visual words are an effective dimension reduction method for the bag-of-visual-words model in image classification. The approach of hierarchically merging visual words has been extensively employed, because it gives a fully determined merging hierarchy. Existing supervised hierarchical merging methods take different approaches and realize the merging process with various formulations. In this paper, we propose a unified hierarchical merging approach built upon the graph-embedding framework. Our approach is able to merge visual words for any scenario, where a preferred structure and an undesired structure are defined, and, therefore, can effectively attend to all kinds of requirements for the word-merging process. In terms of computational efficiency, we show that our algorithm can seamlessly integrate a fast search strategy developed in our previous work and, thus, well maintain the state-of-the-art merging speed. To the best of our survey, the proposed approach is the first one that addresses the hierarchical visual word mergence in such a flexible and unified manner. As demonstrated, it can maintain excellent image classification performance even after a significant dimension reduction, and outperform all the existing comparable visual word-merging methods. In a broad sense, our work provides an open platform for applying, evaluating, and developing new criteria for hierarchical word-merging tasks.

"A soft parameter function penalized normalized maximum correntropy criterion (SPF-NMCC) algorithm is proposed for sparse system identification. The proposed SPF-NMCC algorithm is derived on the basis of the normalized adaptive filter theory, the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) algorithm and zero-attracting techniques. A soft parameter function is incorporated into the cost function of the traditional normalized MCC (NMCC) algorithm to exploit the sparsity properties of the sparse signals. The proposed SPF-NMCC algorithm is mathematically derived in detail. As a result, the proposed SPF-NMCC algorithm can provide an efficient zero attractor term to effectively attract the zero taps and near-zero coefficients to zero, and, hence, it can speed up the convergence. Furthermore, the estimation behaviors are obtained by estimating a sparse system and a sparse acoustic echo channel. Computer simulation results indicate that the proposed SPF-NMCC algorithm can achieve a better performance in comparison with the MCC, NMCC, LMS (least mean square) algorithms and their zero attraction forms in terms of both convergence speed and steady-state performance.

"Adaptive regional total electron content space distribution model, based on the data of the IGS (International GPS Service for Geophysics) international network of GPS-stations is proposed in the article. The method of the spherical harmonic analysis with the selection of the spectrum of approximating harmonic with the greatest contribution was applied at creation of the model. The method essence consists in a such spherical harmonics series spectrum selection when the harmonics, with orthogonal projection exceeding an input data errors level appropriate number of times, are used in an approximating function. The comparative estimation of results obtained by the least squares process and throug offered method has executed. The usage of the least squares process when solving the problem of the spherical harmonics analysis at reconstructing the space distribution of the total electronic contents because of the poor conditionality of normal equations system, results in considerable errors of approximating strongly dependent on selected the length of series. The selection of the spherical harmonics series spectrum with the greatest contribution allows to regularize the normal equations system solution and to increase its accuracy and stability. The model can be used to increase the accuracy of detecting satellite radionavigation system users in a relative navigation mode, at ionospheric monitoring etc.

"Based on the aerodynamic interaction between the heaving vortex-induced vibration and the torsional flutter, another explanation of the drastic change of the vibrational mode from the 5th symmetrical heaving mode to the 1st asymmetrical torsional mode is introduced. Some fundamental characteristics of the coupled flutter of a thin plate and a plate like structure, such as the flutter modes, the flutter branches, are explained by use of the ""Step-by-Step flutter analysis"". The flutter properties obtained by the 3DOF multi-modes-flutter analysis are compared with the ones by the 2DOF 2modes- flutter analysis t. 3DOF multi-modes flutter analysis is recommended to use for more accurate verification of the flutter property as the lessons from the aerodynamic behavior of the full-scale elastic model of Akashi Kaikyo Bridge. The reduction of the key equivalent aerodynamic derivatives, by suitable span-wise arrangement of the girders with different girder-shapes, is significantly effective to stabilize the flutter instability of a long spanned suspension bridge. Furthermore, the significantly similar formula with the Selberg formula can be derived under the simple assumptions. As an application of the coupled flutter, the generation mechanism of the propulsion force by use of coupled flutter motion is introduced. Finally, it is confirmed that the H-90 mode can produce the propulsion force by the test of the ship-navigation with the flapping plate controlled in the particular flutter mode is shown.

"As a powerful nonparametric Bayesian model, the infinite mixture model has been successfully used in machine learning and computer vision. The success of the in fi nite mixture model owes to the capability clustering and density estimation. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian model for single-image super-resolution. Specifically, we combine the Dirichlet process and Gaussian process regression for estimating the distribution of the training patches and modeling the relationship between the low-resolution and high-resolution patches: 1) the proposed method groups the training patches by utilizing the clustering property of Dirichlet process; 2) the proposed method relates the low-resolution and highresolution patches by predicting the property of Gaussian process; and 3) the mentioned two points are not independent but jointly learned. Hence, the proposed method can make full use of the nonparametric Bayesian model. First, the Dirichlet process mixture model is used to obtain more accurate clusters for training patches. Second, Gaussian process regression is established on each cluster, and this directly reduces the computational complexity. Finally, the two procedures are learned simultaneously to gain the suitable clusters with the ability of prediction. The parameters can be inferred simply via the Gibbs sampling technique. Thorough super-resolution experiments on various images demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to some state-of-the-art methods.

"As the variety of new social media applications are developed at an ever-increasing rate, the number of related potential vulnerabilities and related attack vectors are also increasing. Traditionally, social engineering attacks have always been a major cause of concern for Information Security departments. However, the theft, abuse and manipulation of personal information for malicious purposes has become even prolific since the mass adoption of social media and gaming applications by the average person, largely fueled by the boom in social media and gaming applications. These newly introduced and ever-evolving apps continue to introduce new vulnerabilities due to poor system design and coding practices and have led to a multitude of sophisticated attacks and digital crimes. Attacks such as, Malware infections, ransomware, Session Hijacking, SQL Injection, and Man-in-the-Middle attacks have been facilitated in part by the race to developing social media platforms, and applications. Hence, more effective countermeasures and prevention techniques are introduced to detect and minimize the resulting damage and losses associated with this trend. This paper presents a novel 'credentials crawling' proof of concept exploit to illustrate the ease with which such attacks can be launched. The proof of concept is implemented via a stealthy application, which has been implemented (in part) using a commercial of-the-shelf application (Camera Mouse 2011). The newly developed stealth robot uses stealth techniques to conceal itself from the intended target/victim. The proposed approach enables the developed robot application to remain undetected by leading commercial anti-virus solutions. The developed robot has been tested in different environments, with various operating systems protected by various commercial antivirus solutions. The presented approach was tested on computers belonging to people from different walks of life including graduate and undergraduate students, faculty and staff (with their consent). The initial test result demonstrates that the proposed technique is effective as a tool to assist with promoting awareness against a variety of user-focused cyber-attacks especially phishing attacks.

"Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the influence of custom-fit mouthguards on the aerobic performance of soccer and futsal players under 17 (U-17). Material and methods: Forty players from 3 Brazilian clubs participated in the study. The athletes' aerobic performance was assessed through the 20-meter shuttle-run test. All athletes performed two tests with and without mouthguard. Two outcome variables were analyzed: (i) the total distance covered in the test (meters) and (ii) the maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 max). A questionnaire assessing the level of acceptance of mouthguards considering different parameters was administered to the athletes before the delivery of the mouthguards and after 2 weeks of use. The questionnaire used a visual analogue scale (VAS). Paired t-test was used to compare the results obtained from the shuttle-run tests and the questionnaires. Results: Mouthguards did not influence the aerobic performance of the players, considering both the total distance covered in the tests and the VO2 max. Stability was the parameter with the highest acceptance. Levels of acceptance regarding breathing (P = 0.022) and communication (P = 0.002) increased after mouthguards usage. Communication had the lowest level of acceptance considering all parameters assessed. Only 10% of the players reported receiving recommendations to use mouthguards while playing football or futsal. None of the participants reported having used mouthguards before. Conclusions: The use of custom-fit mouthguards does not affect the aerobic performance of soccer and futsal U-17 players. Future studies should focus on the development of appliances with maximum protection and minimum influence on communication.

"As senescence develops, cells sequentially acquire diverse senescent phenotypes along with simultaneous multistage gene reprogramming. It remains unclear what acts as the key regulator of the collective changes in gene expression at initiation of senescent reprogramming. Here we analyzed time series gene expression profiles obtained in two different senescence models in human diploid fibroblasts: replicative senescence and H2O2-induced senescence. Our results demonstrate that suppression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)-mediated DNA methylation activity was an initial event prior to the display of senescent phenotypes. We identified seven DNMT1-interacting proteins, ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 1 (UHRF1), EZH2, CHEK1, SUV39H1, CBX5, PARP1, and HELLS (also known as LSH (lymphoid-specific helicase) 1), as being commonly down-regulated at the same time point as DNMT1 in both senescence models. Knockdown experiments revealed that, among the DNMT1-interacting proteins, only UHRF1 knockdown suppressed DNMT1 transcription. However, UHRF1 overexpression alone did not induce DNMT1 expression, indicating that UHRF1 was essential but not sufficient for DNMT1 transcription. Although UHRF1 knockdown effectively induced senescence, this was significantly attenuated by DNMT1 overexpression, clearly implicating the UHRF1/DNMT1 axis in senescence. Bioinformatics analysis further identified WNT5A as a downstream effector of UHRF1/DNMT1-mediated senescence. Senescence-associated hypomethylation was found at base pairs -1569 to -1363 from the transcription start site of the WNT5A gene in senescent human diploid fibroblasts. As expected, WNT5A overexpression induced senescent phenotypes. Overall, our results indicate that decreased UHRF1 expression is a key initial event in the suppression of DNMT1-mediated DNA methylation and in the consequent induction of senescence via increasing WNT5A expression.

"Aim: The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is found in afferent sensory nerve fibers innervating the resistance arteries and plays a pivotal role in a number of neurovascular diseases such as migraine and subarachnoid bleedings. The present study investigates the binding and antagonistic characteristics of small non-peptide CGRP receptor antagonists (i.e. gepants) in isolated rat brain and mesenteric resistance arteries. Methods: The antagonistic behavior of gepants was investigated in isolated rat mesenteric arteries using a wire myograph setup while binding of gepants to CGRP receptors was investigated in rat brain membranes using a radioligand competitive binding assay. Furthermore, the histological location of the key components of CGRP receptor (RAMP1 and CLR) was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results: Our functional studies clearly show that all gepants are reversible competitive antagonists producing Schild plot slopes not significantly different from unity and thus suggesting presence of a uniform CGRP receptor population in the arteries. A uniform receptor population was also confirmed by radioligand competitive binding studies showing similar affinities for the gepants in rat brain and mesenteric arteries, the exception being rimegepant which had 50-fold lower affinity in brain than mesenteric arteries. CLR and RAMP1 were shown to be located in both vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells of rat mesenteric arteries by immunohistochemistry. Conclusion: The present results indicate that, despite species differences in the CGRP receptor affinity, the antagonistic nature of these gepants, the distribution pattern of CGRP receptor components and the mechanism behind CGRP-induced vasodilation seem to be similar in resistance-sized arteries of human and rats.

Findings: Of 357 fecal samples collected from captive Eurasian wild boars in China, 155 (43.4%) were infected with Cryptosporidium, G. duodenalis and/or E. bieneusi. The infection rates significantly differed in different areas, but did not differ between wild boars kept indoors and outdoors. Three (0.8%), 11 (3.1%) and 147 (41.2%) fecal samples were positive for Cryptosporidium, G. duodenalis and E. bieneusi, respectively. Sequence analysis of SSU rRNA gene revealed that all of the Cryptosporidium strains belonged to C. scrofarum. Based on the sequence analysis of the agiardia gene of G. duodenalis, assemblages E and A were characterized. Fourteen E. bieneusi genotypes comprising five novel (WildBoar 7-11) and eight known (EbpC, F, CHG19, CHC5, PigEBITS5, D, RWSH4, SC02) genotypes were identified by ITS sequencing. EbpC was the most frequent genotype, detected in 85 specimens. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all 14 genotypes belonged to Group 1. Conclusions: This first report on the occurrence of Cryptosporidium, G. duodenalis and E. bieneusi in captive wild boars in China indicates that the presence of zoonotic species/assemblages/genotypes poses a threat to public health. The findings suggest that wild boars could be a significant source of human infection and water pollution.

"As urbanisation and land development rapidly increase, water quality stress due to urban stormwater runoff is becoming an increasingly prominent problem. Although a variety of technologies exist to improve urban runoff quality, ultra-urban areas pose a specific challenge. Geotextile filters, which are easy to maintain and have a long lifespan, can be an alternative to sand filters in urban areas as demonstrated in previous laboratory studies. This study examines the field effectiveness of a geotextile filter as a means of stormwater runoff treatment in Maryland. The results indicate that the filter is able to significantly reduce total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations in parking lot stormwater. Of the 18 storms analysed for TSS, 16 demonstrated an event mean concentration (EMC) less than the target value of 25 mg/l. However, no significant reduction of total phosphorus EMC occurred through the filters. Porosities and characteristic pore opening sizes of the field-exhumed geotextiles dropped 65-82%, accompanied by comparable permittivities; however, the final hydraulic conductivities of the field-exhumed geotextiles were still 25 times higher than that of a typical unclogged uniform sand. Stormwater TSS geotextile modelling developed in an earlier study was successful in predicting hydraulic conductivity decrease in the field.

"Background: Hemodiafiltration with on-line endogenous reinfusion (HFR) is an extracorporeal dialytic method that combines diffusion, convection and adsorption. HFR-Supra (HFR-S) is a second-generation system with increased convective permeability and adsorption capability. Previous studies suggested that HFR reduces oxidative stress compared to standard haemodialysis. The principal aim of the present study was to compare antioxidant vitamins behavior and oxidative status of hemodialysis patients treated with HFR and HFR-S. Methods: The study was designed as a multicenter, randomized, crossover trial. Forty-one patients were recruited from 19 dialysis centers and after a 4-month washout stabilization period in on-line hemodiafiltration (ol-HDF), each patient was randomized to a sequence of treatments (HFR-S followed by HFR or viceversa) with each treatment applied over 6 months. Plasma levels of Advanced Oxidation Protein Products, Total Antioxidant Status, vitamins C, A and E and their ligands (Retinol Binding Protein and total lipids) were measured at baseline and at the end of each treatment period. Results: Results show that the higher convective permeability of HFR-S with respect to HFR did not produce additional beneficial effects on the patients' oxidative status, a slight decrease of both Vitamin A and Retinol Binding Protein being the only difference registered in the long-term. However, as compared to ol-HDF, both the re-infusive techniques allowed to reduce the intradialytic loss of Vitamin C and, in the long-term, improve the patients' oxidative status and increase Retinol Binding Protein plasma values. No significant differences were found between the Vitamin C concentration of pre- and post cartridge UF neither in HFR-S nor in HFR showing that the sorbent resin does not adsorb Vitamin C. Conclusion: HFR-S and HFR are almost equivalent in term of impact on antioxidant vitamins and oxidative status of hemodialysis patients. Nonetheless, as compared to ol-HDF, both treatments produced a sensible sparing of Vitamin C and may represent a new approach for reducing oxidative stress and related complications in dialysis patients. Longterm effects of re-infusive treatments on patients' cardiovascular morbidity and mortality need to be evaluated.

"Background: The purpose of this study was to examine the baseline function and results of arthroscopic cuff repair in shoulders with small and medium-sized full-thickness cuff tears with complete supraspinatus disruption compared with those with an intact anterior supraspinatus tendon. Methods: The study evaluated 112 subjects with small and medium-sized cuff tears. Subjects were grouped according to anterior supraspinatus integrity (83 shoulders intact, group 1; and 29 shoulders with anterior supraspinatus tendon disruption, group 2). Functional assessments included visual analogue scale for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Simple Shoulder Test score, and Constant score. Repair integrity was assessed by ultrasound examination. Results: Group 2 shoulders had greater mean tear width, length, and area (P < .0001) and greater supraspinatus muscle degenerative changes (P < .0001) compared with shoulders with an intact anterior supraspinatus tendon. There were no differences in demographics or baseline function (ASES score: 45 group 1 vs 46 group 2, P = .79; Constant score: 56 group 1 vs 52 group 2, P = .29) before surgery. There were no differences in any functional parameter (ASES score: 92 group 1 vs 93 group 2, P = .71; Constant score: 84 group 1 vs 85 group 2, P = .84) after surgery. There was no difference in tendon healing rates (93% group 1 vs 86% group 2; P = .26). Conclusions: In the setting of painful small and medium-sized rotator cuff tears, disruption of the anterior supraspinatus tendon was associated with greater tear size and more advanced supraspinatus muscle degeneration. However, anterior supraspinatus tendon integrity had no influence on the clinical presentation or the functional and structural results of cuff repair surgery.

"Aim: Amyloid-beta (A beta)-mediated neurotoxicity plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which induces oxidative stress and apoptosis. Linalool (LI) is a volatile monoterpene showing positive effect in AD treatment. This study was designed to research the protective effect of LI against neurotoxicity and cognitive deficits induced by A beta(1-40) in mice. Main methods: A beta(1-40) (4 mu g) solution was injected in the bilateral hippocampus to induce cognitive deficits of mice. The protective effects of LI were evaluated by behavioral tests and the related mechanism was further explored by observing the apoptosis and oxidative stress changes in the hippocampus of mice. Key findings: LI (100 mg/kg, i.p.) administration significantly improved the cognitive performance of model mice in Morris water maze test and step-through test. Meanwhile, LI effectively reversed the A beta(1-40) induced hippocampal cell injury in histological examination, apoptosis in TUNEL assay, changes of oxidative stress indicators (SOD, GPX, AChE). Besides, the activated cleaved caspase (caspase-3, caspase-9) was suppressed and Nrf2, HO-1 expression was elevated by LI treatment. Significance: LI could attenuate cognitive deficits induced by A beta, and the neuroprotective effect of LI might be mediated by alleviation of apoptosis, oxidative stress depending on activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. We could assume that LI has the potential to be a neuroprotective substance for AD therapy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"Background: Image-guided endovascular interventions have gained increasing popularity in clinical practice, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is emerging as an attractive alternative to X-ray fluoroscopy for guiding such interventions. Steering catheters by remote control under MRI guidance offers unique challenges and opportunities. Methods: In this review, the benefits and limitations of MRI-guided remote control intervention are addressed, and the tools for guiding such interventions in the magnetic environment are summarized. Designs for remote control catheter guidance include a catheter tip electromagnetic microcoil design, a ferromagnetic sphere-tipped catheter design, smart material-actuated catheters, and hydraulically actuated catheters. Remote control catheter guidance systems were compared and contrasted with respect to visualization, safety, and performance. Performance is characterized by bending angles achievable by the catheter, time to achieve bending, degree of rotation achievable, and miniaturization capacity of the design. Necessary improvements for furthering catheter design, especially for use in the MRI environment, are addressed, as are hurdles that must be overcome in order to make MRI guided endovascular procedures more accessible for regular use in clinical practice. Conclusions: MR-guided endovascular interventions under remote control steering are in their infancy due to issues regarding safety and reliability. Additional experimental studies are needed prior to their use in humans.

"Aim: We previously reported a protective effect of maternal omega-3 fatty acid supplements on the development of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-associated disease in infancy. This study assessed omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) in maternal milk in relation to omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation and the development of allergic disease in their infants. Methods: This study randomised 95 pregnant women at risk of having an allergic infant, to daily supplements of 2.6 g omega-3 LCPUFA or a placebo of 2.7 g soya bean oil from gestational week 25 until 3 months of lactation. Breast milk samples were collected as colostrum, at one and 3 months. Milk fatty acids were related to allergic outcome in the infants at 24 months. Results: Omega-3 milk fatty acids were higher in women who received omega-3 supplements than the placebo group (p < 0.01). Higher proportions of milk eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid and a lower arachidonic/ eicosapentaenoic acid ratio were associated with an absence of IgE-associated disease in the infants. None of the children developed IgE-associated atopic eczema above a level of 0.83 mol% eicosapentaenoic acid in colostrum. [Correction added on 7 July 2016, after online publication: In the preceding sentence, the correct word should be "" above"" instead of "" below"" and this has been amended in this current version.] Conclusion: High omega-3 LCPUFA milk levels in mothers who received omega-3 LCPUFA supplements were related to fewer allergies in their children.

"As scientific applications become more data intensive, finding an efficient scheduling strategy for massive computing on network-based computing systems has drawn increasingly attention. Most existing scheduling models assume that all processors are idle at the beginning of workload assignment. In fact, in the real distributed computing environments, processors may still be occupied with any previous assigned workload when a new load arrives. The time period between busy to idle states of a processor is referred to as its release time. Based on the fact that processors have arbitrary release times, we propose a new divisible-load scheduling model with hybrid time constraints and design an effective global optimization genetic algorithm to solve it. Finally, experiment results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

"Background: Pseudoparalysis is defined as active forward flexion less than 90 degrees with full passive motion. There is controversy about the ideal surgical management of a massive rotator cuff tear with pseudoparalysis. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to prospectively analyze the ability to reverse pseudoparalysis with an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR). The hypothesis was that in the absence of substantial glenohumeral arthritis, preoperative fatty infiltration of grade 3 or higher and an acromiohumeral interval (AHI) of less than 7 mm would not prevent reversal of pseudoparalysis with an ARCR. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A prospective multicenter study of ARCR performed for preoperative pseudoparalysis was conducted. The minimum follow-up was 1 year. The mean patient age was 63 years, and pseudoparalysis was present for a mean of 4.2 months preoperatively. Preoperative radiographic evaluation included plain film evaluation of the AHI and Hamada classification and MRI evaluation of fatty degeneration and rotator cuff retraction. Functional outcome was determined by the Simple Shoulder Test (SST), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Shoulder Score, visual analog scale (VAS), and subjective shoulder value (SSV). Results: Of the 58 patients enrolled, 56 had at least 1 year of follow-up. Mean active forward flexion improved from 47 degrees preoperatively to 159 degrees postoperatively (P < .001). Statistically significant improvements were seen in the SST (from 2.8 preoperatively to 10.1 postoperatively), SSV (from 28 to 83), ASES Shoulder Score (from 37 to 88), and VAS (from 5.7 to 1.1) (P < .001). Pseudoparalysis was reversed in 53 of 56 patients (95%). There was no difference in the rate of reversal of pseudoparalysis between those patients with an AHI of less than 7 mm (88.2%) and those with an AHI of 7 mm or more (96.9%) (P =.289). Pseudoparalysis was reversed in all 8 of the patients with fatty degeneration of grade 3 or higher in 1 or more of the rotator cuff muscles. Conclusion: ARCR can lead to reversal of preoperative pseudoparalysis in patients with minimal preoperative glenohumeral arthritis. ARCR is a viable first line of treatment for patients with pseudoparalysis in the absence of advanced glenohumeral arthritis.

"Aim: Early intervention and prevention of serious mental disorders such as bipolar disorder has the promise of decreasing the burden associated with these disorders. With increasing early and preventive intervention efforts among cohorts such as those with a familial risk for bipolar disorder, there is a need to examine the associated ethical concerns. The aim of this review was to examine the ethical issues underpinning the clinical research on pre-onset identification and preventive interventions for bipolar disorder. Methods: We undertook a PubMed search updated to November 2014 incorporating search terms such as bipolar, mania, hypomania, ethic* (truncated), early intervention, prevention, genetic and family. Results: Fifty-six articles that were identified by this method as well as other relevant articles were examined within a framework of ethical principles including beneficence, nonmaleficence, respect for autonomy and justice. The primary risks associated with research and clinical interventions include stigma and labelling, especially among familial high-risk youth. Side effects from interventions are another concern. The benefits of preventive or early interventions were in the amelioration of symptoms as well as the possibility of minimizing disability, cognitive impairment and progression of the illness. Supporting the autonomy of individuals and improving access to stigma-free care may help moderate the potential challenges associated with the risks of interventions. Conclusions: Concerns about the risks of early identification and pre-onset interventions should be balanced against the potential benefits, the individuals' right to choice and by improving availability of services that balance such dilemmas.

"As the detection methods of covert channels can provide a better way to detect the existence of advanced persistent threat, it has become a hot research topic in the field of network security. Although the existing methods can achieve feasible performance for detecting the JitterBug covert timing channel, they are ineffective when the covert timing channels are implemented with sparse embedding, especially for low embedding probability. In this paper, a new method to detect JitterBug covert timing channel with sparse embedding is proposed, in which the timing intervals are first modeled in histogram statistics, and then the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic is used for detection. In addition, the diversifications of the references and the model updating scheme in practical usage are analyzed. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective when the embedding probability is 0.3, while the existing methods can effective only when the embedding probability is larger than 0.6.

"AIM To systematically review literature addressing three key psychologically-oriented controversies associated with gastroparesis. METHODS A comprehensive search of PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases was performed to identify literature addressing the relationship between gastroparesis and psychological factors. Two researchers independently screened all references. Inclusion criteria were: an adult sample of gastroparesis patients, a quantitative methodology, and at least one of the following: (1) evaluation of the prevalence of psychopathology; (2) an outcome measure of anxiety, depression, or quality of life; and (3) evidence of a psychological intervention. Case studies, review articles, and publications in languages other than English were excluded from the current review. RESULTS Prevalence of psychopathology was evaluated by three studies (n = 378), which found that combined anxiety/ depression was present in 24% of the gastroparesis cohort, severe anxiety in 12.4%, depression in 21.8%-23%, and somatization in 50%. Level of anxiety and depression was included as an outcome measure in six studies (n = 1408), and while limited research made it difficult to determine the level of anxiety and depression in the cohort, a clear positive relationship with gastroparesis symptom severity was evident.Quality of life was included as an outcome measure in 11 studies (n = 2076), with gastroparesis patients reporting lower quality of life than population norms, and a negative relationship between quality of life and symptom severity. One study assessed the use of a psychological intervention for gastroparesis patients (n = 120) and found that depression and gastric function were improved in patients who received psychological intervention, however the study had considerable methodological limitations. CONCLUSION Gastroparesis is associated with significant psychological distress and poor quality of life. Recommendations for future studies and the development of psychological interventions are provided.

"As Automatic Test Systems continue to adopt architectures based on synthetic instrumentation and modular I/O platforms, software is eclipsing hardware as the primary input for determining technology insertion cadence and scope. While abstracting Test Programs Sets from specific hardware is commonly referenced as a valuable tactic to reduce the risks of I/O obsolescence, it also requires significant up-front investment with a return that is later determined by the frequency of change. As systems become increasingly software-centric, a cost optimized development strategy requires bounding technology insertion options, evaluating the costs associated with developing driver and measurement layers across those options, and managing the costs of migrating across application software and operating systems as a function of time. This paper will discuss the evolving solution space for software dominated technology insertion strategies through an examination of the underlying compatibility of the COTS components at play.

"At the UN-Paris conference in 2015 countries accepted the challenge to fight Green House Gas emissions (GHG) during the next decades in an attempt to stop global warming. In Europe the aim is that all future new buildings aim at nearly zero-energy consumption and be highly material efficient whilst the existing building stock will be refurbished at a rate of 2% annually. Numerous international scientific studies have found that timber-framed buildings result in lower GHG emissions than their steel and concrete counterparts. For green building construction (relative) new timber products and connection methods conquer the market such as Cross Laminated Timber products. CLT products allow fast and cost effective execution of the building while structural limitations and disadvantages of the traditional timber frame construction are overcome. Examples of multi-storey timber structures are presented. These steps forward were ministered by the development of innovative timber fastener connections like self-tapping screws and reinforced dvw tube connections. (C) 2017 The Authors.

"Attractiveness of magnesium alloys for structural applications is caused by their intrinsic properties i.e. low density and high specific strength. The main challenge in development of magnesium alloys is connected with requirement to fulfill the main function of structural materials i.e. to bear load. Wrought magnesium alloys possess strong basal texture which causes anisotropy of mechanical properties. It would be interesting to find out the way how to benefit from this anisotropic behavior of magnesium alloys. One way is to take into account strong basal texture and {1 0 -1 2} twinning in magnesium alloys under compressive deformation. Parallelepiped samples of AZ31 magnesium alloy were successively deformed in compression with 3.5% strain along two perpendicular directions. During first compression the sample contracts along the RD direction parallel to compression axis, elongates only in one perpendicular ND direction and no deformation is observed in third perpendicular TD direction. Subsequent compression along the ND direction recovers the initial shape of the sample. Microstructure analyses shows that the {1 0 -1 2} twinning is the main deformation mode during compression along the RD direction and twin variants which gives 0% strain to TD direction are predominant in microstructure. Twinfree microstructure is observed after subsequent compression along the ND direction. Crystallographic analyzes and calculations explain why reversible motion of twin boundaries is more favorable than nucleation of other twin variants in matrix grains during compression along the ND direction. The experiment presented in this article profile wrought magnesium alloy as smart material and emphasize the importance of strong {0 0 0 1}texture and {1 0 -1 2} twinning in obtaining the properties characteristic for smart materials. In the presented case, it is the ability to produce and recover significant strains in a controlled manner under compressive stress. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Background: Subscapularis insufficiency is a debilitating condition with few treatment options. Historically, pectoralis major tendon transfer has been suggested when the subscapularis tendon or muscle is deemed irreparable; however, the results of this salvage procedure have been mixed. Methods: A comprehensive review of the peer-reviewed literature addressing pectoralis major tendon transfers was performed. The clinical presentation, relevant anatomy, biomechanical rationale, surgical indications, technical considerations, reported outcomes, and significant complications are reviewed in this report. Where possible, attempts at direct comparison of outcomes among surgical techniques and surgical indications have been made. Results and Conclusions: Despite the heterogeneous reporting of clinical results, it is clear that surgical indications affect outcomes. Specifically, isolated subscapularis insufficiency shows the best prognosis with pectoralis major tendon transfer. Patients with anterosuperior instability after large rotator cuff tears or shoulder arthroplasty have the least predictable pain relief and worse functional outcomes.

"Aim: To assess the protective role of breast-feeding in infants with CMPA-related AEDS as well as IL-10 utility as marker of disease evolution. Methods: 64 breast-feeding children with CMPA-related AEDS (31 males and 33 females; mean age 5.56 +/- 2.41 months; 21 mild AEDS; 25 moderate AEDS; 18 severe AEDS) and 60 artificial feeding babies (33 males and 27 females; mean age 6.01 +/- 2.08 months; 26 mild AEDS; 19 moderate AEDS; 15 severe AEDS) were evaluated. In all patients serum IL-10 levels were detected. Results: Significant Score Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index point differences between breastfed and not breastfed children (p <0.001) have been detected. The serum IL-10 levels were lower in children with CMPA-related AEDS as compared to the healthy control group (p < 0.001). Moreover, a significant inverse correlation between serum IL-10 levels and SCORAD in both enrolled groups has been also noted. In particular, IL-10 levels, in both groups, were significantly lower in children with severe symptoms. Conversely, serum IL-10 levels were significantly increased in children with mild-severe symptoms in both groups. Furthermore, breastfed children, with lower severe symptoms, had higher serum IL-10 levels. Finally, serum total IgE levels were negatively correlated with serum IL-10 levels in both breastfed and non-breastfed children with CMPA-related AEDS (p < 0.001). Conclusions: We reported that exclusive breast-feeding induces hyposensitization in children with CMPA-related AEDS and it is associated with minor disease severity and higher serum IL-10 levels, resulting as useful disease-monitor marker.

"Aim: There has been a lack of research on adolescents who undergo double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges. The aim of this study was to investigate food allergic adolescents' experiences and consequences of double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges. Methods: This qualitative, descriptive interview study included 17 adolescents aged 14-15 years with total elimination of cows' milk, hens' eggs or cod due to food allergies. The participants, who were initially identified from a large population-based cohort study, were interviewed 18 months after completing their challenges. Results: The double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge proved to be a complex experience for the adolescents, involving fear of potential reactions and the hope that the food could be reintroduced. Experiences during the challenge were described in three themes: facing fears in a secure environment, being hesitant but curious about unknown tastes and waiting for unknown food reactions. Experiences after the challenge were described in two themes: gaining control and freedom and continuing old habits. A negative challenge was not consistently associated with the reintroduction of the challenged food. Conclusion: This study highlighted the importance of considering the adolescents' expectations and experiences of the challenge and the reintroduction process to ensure desirable changes in their dietary habits. Follow-ups should be performed regardless of the outcome of challenges.

"Aim: The aim of this article is to evaluate the clinical and cost implications of failed endoscopic hemostasis in patients with gastroduodenal ulcer bleeding. Methods: A retrospective claims analysis of the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR) file was conducted to identify all hospitalizations for gastroduodenal ulcer bleeding in the year 2012. The main outcome measures were to compare all-cause mortality, total length of hospital stay (LOS), hospital costs and payment between patients managed with one upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy versus more than one UGI endoscopy or requiring interventional radiology-guided hemostasis (IRH) or surgery after failed endoscopic attempt. Results: The MedPAR claims data evaluated 13,501 hospitalizations, of which 12,242 (90.6%) reported one UGI endoscopy, 817 (6.05%) reported >1 UGI endoscopy, 303 (2.24%) reported IRH after failed endoscopy and 139 (1.03%) reported surgeries after failed endoscopy. All cause-mortality was significantly lower for patients who underwent only one UGI endoscopy (3%) compared to patients requiring >1 endoscopy (6%), IRH (9%) or surgery (14%), p1 endoscopy (eight days), IRH (nine days) or surgery (15 days), p1 endoscopy ($20,055), IRH ($34,730) or surgery ($47,589), p < 0.0001. Conclusions: Failure to achieve hemostasis at the index endoscopy has significant clinical and cost implications. When feasible, a repeat endoscopy must be attempted followed by IRH.

"As an interesting and emerging topic, co-saliency detection aims at simultaneously extracting common salient objects from a group of images. On one hand, traditional co-saliency detection approaches rely heavily on human knowledge for designing hand-crafted metrics to possibly reflect the faithful properties of the co-salient regions. Such strategies, however, always suffer from poor generalization capability to flexibly adapt various scenarios in real applications. On the other hand, most current methods pursue co-saliency detection in unsupervised fashions. This, however, tends to weaken their performance in real complex scenarios because they are lack of robust learning mechanism to make full use of the weak labels of each image. To alleviate these two problems, this paper proposes a new SP-MIL framework for co-saliency detection, which integrates both multiple instance learning (MIL) and self-paced learning (SPL) into a unified learning framework. Specifically, for the first problem, we formulate the co-saliency detection problem as a MIL paradigm to learn the discriminative classifiers to detect the co-saliency object in the ""instance-level"". The formulated MIL component facilitates our method capable of automatically producing the proper metrics to measure the intra-image contrast and the inter-image consistency for detecting co-saliency in a purely self-learning way. For the second problem, the embedded SPL paradigm is able to alleviate the data ambiguity under the weak supervision of co-saliency detection and guide a robust learning manner in complex scenarios. Experiments on benchmark datasets together with multiple extended computer vision applications demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework beyond the state-of-the-arts.

"Aim: We aimed to identify clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with onset of high-altitude headache (HAH) after acute exposure at 3700m. Method: In two hours, 163 individuals ascended by plane to 3700m. Demographic information, physiological and psychological measurements, cognitive function, physical work capacity tests and profile of mood states within one week prior to the departure and within 24 hours after arrival were examined. Results: HAH patients featured significantly higher vertebral artery diastolic velocity (V-d), heart rate (HR) and pulmonary artery diameter. HAH was also associated with a more negative mood state, including scores for tension anxiety, depression, hostility, fatigue and confusion, as well as lower vigor (all p values <0.05). Furthermore, negative emotions were positively related to HAH severity. HAH slightly decreased cognitive functioning. HR, V-d, lack of vigor, confusion and self-reported anxiety (all p values <0.05) were independent risk factors for HAH. We have identified three independent baseline predictors for HAH including internal diameter of the left ventricle (LVD), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and confusion score. Conclusions: Higher HR, V-d, confusion and self-reported anxiety and insufficient vigor were independent risk factors for HAH. Furthermore, higher baseline LVD, AIS and confusion score are independent predictors of HAH.

"AimProlonged QT interval is related to changes of electrolytes in haemodialysis (HD) and is associated with all-cause mortality in HD patients. It is unknown if prolonged QT interval is associated with all-cause mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients as the electrolytes were relatively stable in PD. We therefore investigated the association of prolonged QT interval and all-cause mortality in chronic PD patients. MethodsThe QT intervals were measured in 2003 and all patients were followed to December 2012. A prolonged QT interval was defined as a QT interval>450ms. The association of prolonged QT interval with all-cause and cardiac-specific mortality was analyzed using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis. ResultsOf 306 patients, 196 (64%) patients had prolonged QT interval. The incidence density rate was 9.7 per 100 persons-years for all-cause mortality and 5.6 for cardiac specific mortality in patients with prolonged QT interval. Prolonged QT interval was associated with all-cause mortality with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.59 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-2.39, P=0.03] and cardiac mortality (HR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.00-2.78, P=0.05) with adjustments for age, gender, diabetes, and vintage of dialysis. Longer QT interval (>500ms, 450-500ms, and<450ms) was significantly associated with a worse overall survival (P=0.03, log-rank test) and cardiac mortality free survival (P=0.05, log-rank test). ConclusionsProlonged QT interval was associated with all-cause and cardiac mortality in patients on peritoneal dialysis. The association is independent of patient's age and diabetes.

"A systematic design approach using signal flow graph (SFG) is presented in this paper, tailored for integrated reconfigurable switched-capacitor (SC) power converters. To achieve an optimal power stage, an unified signal flow graph (USFG) model is developed. System transfer function and I/O impedance can be evaluated based on it. To verify the design approach, the paper demonstrates a step-up/down reconfigurable SC power converter with five optional gain ratios. A dual-loop control scheme is employed to reconfigure the converter according to the instantaneous line/load conditions. A low-power, digital controller is designed in the subthreshold region for the feedback control loop. The converter was fabricated with a 130-nm CMOS process. Experimental results show that its output can be continuously regulated from 0.4 to 2.2 V, while allowing the input voltage to randomly vary between 0.9 and 1.5 V. The line regulation is maintained below 1.4%, with a lowest value of 0.07%. The maximum efficiency of 90.22% is measured at 0.55-V output voltage and 20-mW load.

"A symbolic method is presented for calculation of the weakly nonlinear distortion effect of operational amplifiers. To avoid complicated symbolic generation by considering all transistor nonlinearities, a simplified analysis method is adopted. This method identifies the nonlinearity of each amplifier stage by a low-order polynomial. The proposed symbolic method can derive analytical distortion results automatically without the need of going through lengthy signal-flow graph analysis. This method is applied to sweep analysis of the opamp distortion with respect to the external feedback elements, by which optimal selection of the parameter value can be determined at any given frequency. Remarkable speedup over repeated Spectre simulation has been observed.

"Aim: The study assessed mRNA expression of podocyte-associated molecules in urinary sediments of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) in relation to urinary podocytes, biomarkers of podocyte injury and of proximal tubule (PT) dysfunction. Methods: A total of 76 patients with type 2 DM and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in a cross-sectional study, and assessed concerning urinary podocytes, urinary mRNA of podocyte-associated genes, urinary biomarkers of podocyte damage and of PT dysfunction. Results: We found significant differences between urinary mRNA of podocyte-associated molecules in relation with albuminuria stage. In multivariable regression analysis, urinary mRNA of nephrin, podocin, alpha-actinin-4, CD2-associated protein, glomerular epithelial protein 1 (GLEPP1), ADAM 10, and NF kappa B correlated directly with urinary podocytes, albuminuria, urinary -alpha1-microglobulin, urinary kidney-injury molecule-1, nephrinuria, urinary vascular endothelial growth factor, urinary advanced glycation end-products (AGE), and indirectly with eGFR (p < 0.0001, R-2 = 0.808; p < 0.0001, R-2 = 0.825; p < 0.0001, R-2 = 0.805; p < 0.0001, R-2 = 0.663; p < 0.0001, R-2 = 0.726; p < 0.0001, R-2 = 0.720; p < 0.0001, R-2 = 0.724). Conclusions: In patients with type 2 DM there is an association between urinary mRNA of podocyte-associated molecules, biomarkers of podocyte damage, and of PT dysfunction. GLEPP1, ADAM10, and NF kappa B may be considered additional candidate molecules indicative of early diabetic nephropathy. AGE could be involved in this association.

"Bafa Lake is one of the largest Turkish Lagoon lakes in Aegean Region covering a surface area of 50km(2). Because of its water capacity and myriad benefits in aquaculture facility, agricultural activities and tourism. The lake is considered as an important wetland within Buyuk Menderes basin. This study investigate the aquaculture facilities and anthropogenic sources of pollutions and how they affect the water quality of Bafa Lake. The major factors that control the quality-of Bafa Lake water are agricultural activities in the basin, domestic and industrial wastes that come from Buyuk Menderes River and its surrounding lake, fisheries and aquaculture facilities. Contaminants located in the Lake are continuously having a negative impact on its water quality during the last three decades. The effect of sea bream (Sparus aurata) and sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) cultivation facilities on surface water quality in the Lake were determined. Water samples were taken from five stations between April 2013 and March 2014 from Bafa Lake. Sample were analyzed for water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, amonium nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and orthophosphate. From result surface water quality was assessed based on the comparison of samples collected near aquaculture stations. For reference, a sample was taken outside the cultivation area and compared with the Water Pollution Registration Act (WPRA) standards. According to the WPRA, surface water quality of the Lake was classified as level II. At the end of analyses, it was revealed that the area where aquaculture activities were intense showed high rate of polution than the other 3 stations as well as the reference station. The results show that, aquaculture activities on sea bream and sea bass have a negative impact in the entire Bafa Lake.

"Aim: It is unknown whether food allergies have greater impact on quality of life than respiratory allergies. This study compared health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children allergic to wheat or grass. Methods: We surveyed 63 children with wheat allergies (median age of five) and 72 with grass allergies (median age 12), with their parents. The Child Health Questionnaires for parents (CHQ-PF28) and children (CHQ-CF87) were applied. Results: The parents of children in the wheat group recorded significantly lower CHQ-PF28 scores for the impact of their child's allergy on general behaviour, general health perceptions, parental impact of emotions and time and family activities, than the parents of children with grass allergies (p values <= 0.001). However, parents in the grass group recorded lower scores for the change in health item than the parents of children with wheat allergies (p = 0.020). In the grass group, children and parents reported similar scores for the different questions, but there was poorer correlation between parents and children in the wheat allergy group. Conclusion: HRQoL was lower in children with wheat than grass allergies according to parental reports, with more consistent perceptions of HRQoL among parents and children in the grass allergy than wheat allergy group.

"Aim. To determine which specific groups of occupational stress factors influence the duration of temporary work disability related to arterial hypertension and joint complications/co-morbidities. Methodology. Workers (n=1398; 1009 in the exposed group, 389 in the control group) with arterial hypertension who worked at one workplace for a minimum of 10 years were divided into 10 subgroups, depending on the presence of joint complications/co-morbidities. The intensity of seven groups of occupational stress factors, the total score of Occupational Stress Index (OSI) and the average number of lost working days during 1 year were analysed. Results. The number of lost working days due to arterial hypertension and joint complications/co-morbidities was significantly higher in the exposed group. In all subgroups of the exposed group there was a high correlation between the number of lost working days and the total OSI score. Specific occupational stress factors were associated with specific complications: High Demands with chronic myocardial infarction, Strictness with cerebral haemorrhage, Conflict/Uncertainty with cerebral infarction, Extrinsic Time Pressure with acute myocardial infarction, and Avoidance/Symbolic Aversiveness with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Conclusion. There are specific groups of occupational stress factors which can influence the duration of work disability associated with certain complications and co-morbidities of arterial hypertension.

"As part of transmission network expansion planning (TNEP), a technical and economical assessment of several planning alternatives must be performed in order to ensure fulfillment of the network security criteria and to estimate the alternatives' expected operating costs. This task requires performing load flow calculations for different operating points (OPs) of the power system. Due to the high computational burden, considering all possible OPs is simply not possible. As a consequence, only a set of representative OPs is usually taken into account. Mostworks in the TNEP focus on issues related to optimization algorithms and modeling, neglecting the selection process of the representative OPs. Furthermore, most works only consider a few OPs, providing little or no insight about the criteria used in the selection process or about the error made when evaluating planning alternatives using a limited number of OPs. In this work, a novel methodology for selecting representative OPs to consider within the TNEP is presented. The proposal pays special attention to critical situations, where the network security may be endangered. Furthermore, the methodology allows quantifying the error made when evaluating network operation using a limited number of representative OPs.

"Assessment of the physical properties of agricultural and food products has always been of major importance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of estimating physicochemical properties of raw cane sugars using digital image processing and colorimetric measurements. Various characteristics of raw cane sugars such as ash, sucrose, invert sugar, solution color, pH, starch, dextran, moisture and refractive index of some Iranian and imported raw cane sugar samples were examined. Additionally, the images of samples were captured by a flat scanner, and different morphological characteristics such as area, perimeter, squareness and count number of crystal were determined using MATLAB software. In addition, the CIE color coordinates by a spectroradiometer with wavelength range of 380-780 nm were measured. Results demonstrated that there was a good correlation between certain morphological behaviors and some physicochemical properties of raw cane sugars. For example, some relationships between the area mean and dextran (r = 0.72), perimeter mean and dextran (r = 0.75) and squareness and starch (r = 0.76) were found. Moreover, correlations between certain physicochemical parameters such as ash, sucrose, invert sugar, solution color, dextran, pH and refractive index and some CIE color coordinates values such as L*, a*, b*, C*, h, X, Y, Z, x and y were indicated. Determining the physicochemical properties of raw cane sugars appears feasible using digital image analysis technique.

Their low cost and robustness make them a fit choice for ambient assisted living or other healthcare applications. Nevertheless, similar to many other radio-frequency based technologies, beacons pose serious challenges when it comes to developing applications that require predictability. Moreover, the multipath propagation characteristics of Bluetooth beacons prevent ambient intelligent researchers to solely rely on using theoretical models to describe their behaviors. In this paper, we present an empirical evaluation of Bluetooth beacons behaviors. We describe the observed pattern of the signal through a series of experiments totalizing more than 3 million samples.

"Aim: To investigate the relationship between inflammatory markers and platelet size in generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP). Material and Methods: Periodontal, inflammatory and platelet indices were compared between 59 GAgP patients and 59 healthy subjects. Gingival biopsies from five patients and five healthy subjects were examined by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Changes in patient periodontal and platelet indices were re-evaluated at 3 months after periodontal therapy. Results: Platelet size was decreased significantly in GAgP patients compared to healthy subjects (p <= 0.003). Weak negative correlations between platelet size and periodontal parameters were found in GAgP patients (p <= 0.025). Platelet aggregates and adhesion to the endothelium or leucocytes were found in venules and connective tissues of gingival biopsies from GAgP patients. Mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet large cell ratio increased after periodontal therapy in GAgP patients (p <= 0.038). The increase in MPV was related to the decrease in bleeding index in GAgP patients after periodontal therapy (p < 0.001; r = 0.357). Conclusion: Platelet size was reduced in GAgP patients compared to healthy controls, possibly due to the consumption of large platelets at sites of periodontal inflammation. Platelets may be involved in host responses to periodontal infection in GAgP.

"Based on the cellular automata model, a meticulous two-lane cellular automata model is proposed, in which the driving behavior difference and the difference of vehicles' accelerations between the moving state and the starting state are taken into account. Furthermore the vehicles' motion is refined by using the small cell of one meter long. Then accompanied by coming up with a traffic management measure, a two-lane highway traffic model containing a work zone is presented, in which the road is divided into normal area, merging area and work zone. The vehicles in different areas move forward according to different lane changing rules and position updating rules. After simulation it is found that when the density is small the cluster length in front of the work zone increases with the decrease of the merging probability. Then the suitable merging length and the appropriate speed limit value are recommended. The simulation result in the form of the speed-flow diagram is in good agreement with the empirical data. It indicates that the presented model is efficient and can partially reflect the real traffic. The results may be meaningful for traffic optimization and road construction management.

Recent developments in near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) have enabled non-invasive clarification of brain functions in psychiatric disorders. We prospectively evaluated brain activation in 20 chronic hepatitis C patients with or without IFN-based therapy by using NIRS during a verbal fluency task (VFT). MethodsThe relative concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin were measured while patients completed a questionnaire survey at the start of treatment and at 4 and 12weeks during treatment, using NIRS. ResultsThe VFT performance did not change among the two groups. Patients with IFN-based therapy showed significantly lower activation during VFT in frontal channels at 12weeks than those at the start of treatment and control (P<0.05). Their Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale scores were significantly higher at 12weeks than those at the start of treatment, although major depressive symptoms were not found (8.37.9 vs. 13.2 +/- 6.0, P<0.001). ConclusionThe decrease in oxygenated hemoglobin concentrations of the frontal lobe detected using NIRS in this study reflects hypofunction of the frontal lobe. This functional decline that was caused by IFN-based therapy may be associated with the prodromal phase of depression.

Therefore, a training program was designed considering physiological stress during a competition, in which the athlete would perform with a pad instead of a real opponent in order to prevent injury during preparatory competition. Methods. Twelve elite taekwondo players were selected (ages: 22 +/- 3 years, height: 178.66 +/- 6.58 cm, weight: 69.75 +/- 14.51 kg). VO2 (max) was measured using Bruce's exhaustive test (46.22 +/- 4.61 mL/min/kg). Then the anaerobic power was measured using RAST field method (9.8 +/- 1.08 W/kg). Heart rate (HR) alterations were determined using RPE10 Borog Scale before the competition, at three intervals periods between any round and at the end of the third round. Blood lactate concentration (LA) was evaluated before and after the competition. To evaluate the ratio of fighting to non-fighting activity, a digital video camera was used. During the simulation, taekwondo players performed motor skills simulating a competition with the pads. Change of blood lactate, HR and RPE were measured and compared with competition conditions (the opponents). Data were compared by one-way repeated-measurement analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results. No significant differences were observed between the two conditions of competition and simulation training in HR, LA and RPE variables (P>0.05). Conclusion. Apparently the simulation training inflicts physiological stress on the elite athletes that may be replaced for preparatory competitions before a tournament to avoid possible sports injuries.

"As a basic method for monitoring the activities of Internet applications, traffic identification is very important for Internet management and security. Internet traffic data naturally exhibits imbalanced distributions, but this problem is rarely considered by the research community. Data gravitation-based classification (DGC) is a new classification model for handling imbalance data sets and we proposed an imbalanced DGC (IDGC) model in our previous study. In the present study, we developed an IDGC-based model to resolve imbalanced Internet traffic identification problems. First, we constructed six imbalanced traffic data sets from three original traffic data sets and we then extracted their early stage features according to the packet sizes. In identification experiments, we compared the performance of six standard algorithms, including DGC and four imbalanced algorithms with IDGC. The experimental results demonstrated that the standard classification models could achieve high accuracy with imbalanced traffic data, but their imbalanced performance was not as good, and their generalizability was also a problem. By contrast, IDGC performed very well and in a stable manner in terms of imbalanced performance measures, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness for imbalanced traffic identification.

"A systematic design method for 3-D grid multiscroll chaotic attractors by using staircase nonlinear functions (SNFs) is proposed in this paper. Equations of parameters for 3-D grid multiscroll chaotic attractors are derived in the consideration of the dynamic range for the active device and the number of multiscroll chaotic attractors. 5 x 4 and 4 x 3 of 3-D grid multiscroll chaotic attractors are generated by this method.

Methods: Participants completed questionnaires and an online headache diary and migraine monitor following the International Classification of Headache Disorders at T0 (baseline), T1 (post-training), T2 (6-month follow-up; extended baseline in group 2), T3 (post-training, group 2 only) and T4 (group 1: 16-month follow-up; group 2: 6-month follow-up). Statistical analyses were conducted on the observed data without imputation of missing observations. Results: Both groups were highly comparable. The data over time revealed benefits in response to oBT, with significant between-group differences in the change achieved in the training episodes T2-T0 (group 1) and T4-T2 (group 2). Improved attack frequency (M = -23%) was higher in participants with more (i. e. 4-6) attacks per month at baseline, and the effects of oBT were durable over 16 months of follow-up. Conclusions: oBT is beneficial in frequent episodic migraine, which deserves special efforts in care.

"Based on the unit-cell concept, analytical solutions are presented to predict deformation behaviors of geotextile-encased stone columns at any depth below the top plane of the columns. Under vertical loads at the tops of the stone columns, an axial compression deformation occurs that is often accompanied by a lateral expansion near the top. This deformation characteristic of stone columns was incorporated directly into the proposed analytical method. The shear stress between the encased stone column and the surrounding soil in the vertical direction also was taken into account. In this method, the confining pressure provided by the soil was analyzed based on an analogy with passive earth pressure. The method was verified via comparison with two other analytical solutions. Parametric studies were conducted to investigate the effects of geotextile encasement, vertical applied stress, and column spacing and diameter on the deformation behaviors of columns. The results indicated that geotextile encasement with higher stiffness has a beneficial effect on reducing column bulging and settlement. Moreover, selection of geotextile stiffness for encased stone columns should be done in relation to column diameter and spacing because increased column diameter and decreased spacing have a great effect on settlement reduction.

"Asian soybean rust (ASR), caused by the obligate biotrophic fungus Phakopsora pachyrhizi, can cause losses greater than 80%. Despite its economic importance, there is no soybean cultivar with durable ASR resistance. In addition, the P. pachyrhizi genome is not yet available. However, the availability of other rust genomes, as well as the development of sample enrichment strategies and bioinformatics tools, has improved our knowledge of the ASR secretome and its potential effectors. In this context, we used a combination of laser capture microdissection (LCM), RNAseq and a bioinformatics pipeline to identify a total of 36 350 P. pachyrhizi contigs expressed in planta and a predicted secretome of 851 proteins. Some of the predicted secreted proteins had characteristics of candidate effectors: small size, cysteine rich, do not contain PFAM domains (except those associated with pathogenicity) and strongly expressed in planta. A comparative analysis of the predicted secreted proteins present in Pucciniales species identified new members of soybean rust and new Pucciniales- or P. pachyrhizi-specific families (tribes). Members of some families were strongly up-regulated during early infection, starting with initial infection through haustorium formation. Effector candidates selected from two of these families were able to suppress immunity in transient assays, and were localized in the plant cytoplasm and nuclei. These experiments support our bioinformatics predictions and show that these families contain members that have functions consistent with P. pachyrhizi effectors.

"As GPUs become general purpose, they are outgrowing the co-processor model and require convenient I/O abstractions such as files and network sockets. Recent studies have shown the benefits of native GPU I/O layers, in terms of both programmability and performance. However, due to lack of hardware support, the GPU threads performing I/O calls are forced to busy-wait for the completion of I/O operations, resulting in underutilized hardware, higher power consumption, and reduced system throughput. We argue that I/O-driven preemption improves the performance of existing solutions, despite many challenging system characteristics such as a large kernel state. We analyze the benefits of adding preemption support using a simple system performance model, and, encouraged by the results, explore the design of a software-based preemption mechanism for GPUs. In our prototype, GPUpIO, we implement a source-to-source compiler for state checkpoint and restoration, and a runtime library for scheduling preempted thread-blocks, which together enable I/O-driven preemption for GPUs. We evaluate our prototype across a variety of system parameters and workloads to determine when preemption is worthwhile. We show that in some workloads the I/O-driven preemption approach may indeed double the effective system throughput by completely hiding the I/O latency behind computations. However, we also observe that the software-only solution is currently limited, not only due to its overheads, but also because it does not have sufficient control of the hardware scheduler queue and therefore may lead to starvation of I/O kernels. We then discuss a new hardware feature that, if added, may render a general I/O-driven preemption mechanism on GPUs practical.

"Aim: Irisin, the adipomyokine, released mainly by exercised muscles, participate in the browning of adipose tissue and contribute to the restriction of insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus 2 development. Because of the limited reports describing the effect of irisin on inflammation and immunocompetent cells activation, the present study attempted to assess the influence of various irisin concentrations on basic macrophage activity. Main methods: Studies were carried out on murine RAW 264.7 macrophages cultured in medium enriched with irisin (0 nM, 10 nM, 50 nM, or 100 nM). General cell activity, viability, and proliferation were assessed along with phagocytosis process, and respiratory burst generation. Key finding: Irisin level positively correlates with general cell activity and cell cycle progression as well as with phagocytosis intensity, but negatively correlates with the intensity of respiratory burst generation. No influence of irisin on quiescent cell viability, including apoptosis or necrosis, was observed. Significance: This research is the first to show that irisin modulates macrophage activity by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, which could suggest its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, further studies are needed for the evaluation of influence of irisin on immunocompetent cell function. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"Assessment of attack surface is a formidable challenge for the present-day dynamic networks. Essentially, attack surface (of a computer network) is a subset of network configuration and vulnerabilities that an adversary can use to compromise the target network in an incremental fashion. There are a large number of metrics available for network security risk assessment. However, they fail to measure temporal variation in the network attack surface. To overcome this problem, we propose graph distance metrics based on the Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) and Graph Edit Distance (GED). In particular, we make use of classical graph distance metrics to quantify the distance between a pair of successive attack graphs generated for a dynamic network. Since the attack graph is capable of successfully capturing the attack surface of an underlying network, the distance between a pair of consecutive attack graphs (generated over the observed sampling interval) indicates the change in the network attack surface. To validate the efficacy and usability of graph distance metrics proposed in this study, we have tested 11 different metrics on a set of 3 different network models, viz., Flat, External-Internal, and DMZ. Experimental results show that MCS and GED based graph distance metrics successfully capture the temporal variation in the attack surface and also generate an alert about the security events which are responsible for the change. Using such graph distance metrics, we can pinpoint the events that cause a significant change in the network attack surface, locate most dangerous hosts in the network and the effect of increasing vulnerabilities further on these hosts. The advantage of using these metrics is that they scale polynomially with the graphs size and are independent of the graphs topology. It is also evident from the test results that the performance of MCS and GED based metrics is almost similar and hence the computation of one metric is enough to detect temporal variation in the network attack surface. The MCS and GED based graph distance metrics are oblivious to the AND semantic between the initial conditions in the attack graphs. Thus, there is a scope for improving their performance (sensitivity) by considering the AND semantic. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Active control based on nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) methodology is applied to a candidate but realistic dual coaxial-cylinder wave-energy extractor system with the objective of maximizing energy capture over a range of incident ocean-wave conditions. The extractor consists of an outer cylinder (floater) moving relative to a tension-tethered inner cylinder, driving a permanent-magnet linear generator (PMLG) to acquire power take-off (PTO). The floater dynamics is solved in the time domain with the NMPC to constrain maximum floater motion and simultaneously incorporating the PMLG damping capability. The numerical model of the coupled floater and PTO dynamics is formulated in the state-space representation. The mechanical to electrical conversion efficiency of the PMLG, which was experimentally determined as a function of its power-extraction damping, is considered in the numerical simulation. The NMPC process yields a time-varying profile for the generator damping as the control strategy. Simulation results indicate strongly time-dependent and discontinuous generator-damping requirements for both regular and irregular incident-wave scenarios. However, the NMPC-controlled system significantly outperforms a passive-control, constant-damping system by exhibiting higher peak values of energy-extraction and a broader capturing bandwidth, thus confirming the feasibility and success of the control strategy.

"Adaptive modulation problem is tackled in this paper from a completely new perspective using system dynamics analysis. By establishing the state-space representation of the adaptation system, a feedback controller is designed to adjust the modulation parameter so as to meet the adaptation criteria. Compared to the existing adaptation algorithms, the proposed approach yields an optimal resource allocation without pre-computation of signal to noise ratio (SNR) region boundaries while still maintaining a desirable quality of service.

"As a signing capability delegation technique, multi-proxy signature allows all signers in the delegated group to produce jointly a multi-proxy signature on the behalf of an original signer, and has been widely applied in distributed computing. Currently, most of multi-proxy signature schemes in the standard model cannot achieve strong unforgeablity, lightweight computation and short length of multi-proxy signature. These problems restrict its application since many devices has limited computation capacity and storage space. In this work, a novel multi-proxy signature scheme with short length in the standard model is proposed. The scheme can not only achieve strong unforgeability, but also has short length of the signature. Compared with the other three multi-proxy signature schemes, the proposed scheme has the great advantages over the other three schemes. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed multi-proxy signature scheme is the first shortest size, whose signature length is only 320 bits for a security level of 80 bits and the same length as that of DSA.

"As one of the most classic fields in computer vision, image categorization has attracted widespread interests. Numerous algorithms have been proposed in the community, and many of them have advanced the state-of-the-art. However, most existing algorithms are designed without consideration for the supply of computing resources. Therefore, when dealing with resource constrained tasks, these algorithms will fail to give satisfactory results. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and in-depth introduction of recent developments of the research in image categorization with resource constraints. While a large portion is based on our own work, we will also give a brief description of other elegant algorithms. Furthermore, we make an investigation into the recent developments of deep neural networks, with a focus on resource constrained deep nets.

"A stochastic convergence analysis of the parameter vector estimation obtained by the recursive successive over-relaxation (RSOR) algorithm is performed in mean sense and mean-square sense. Also, excess of mean-square error and misadjustment analysis of the RSOR algorithm is presented. These results are verified by ensemble-averaged computer simulations. Furthermore, the performance of the RSOR algorithm is examined using a system identification example and compared with other widely used adaptive algorithms. Computer simulations show that the RSOR algorithm has better convergence rate than the widely used gradient-based algorithms and gives comparable results obtained by the recursive least-squares RLS algorithm.

"As networks applications are growing fast, data are more generated and transmitted, leaving it vulnerable to modification. Besides that, the significance, sensitivity and preciseness of that information cause a big security issue, increasing the needs to keep it safe. One proper solution for this problem is cryptography, which is a technique used to transform data to unrecognizable information and useless to any unauthorized person. By being the main core of network security and since new attacks techniques are daily invented, ciphers are constantly under test by cryptanalysis attacks to harden their safety. This paper contains a fair comparison between serval ciphers in speed test under different platforms, also in performance and risk to globalize the vision about the most fast safe algorithm.

"Assessing the quality of aperture synthesis maps is relevant for benchmarking image reconstruction algorithms, for the scientific exploitation of data from optical long-baseline interferometers, and for the design/upgrade of new/existing interferometric imaging facilities. Although metrics have been proposed in these contexts, no systematic study has been conducted on the selection of a robust metric for quality assessment. This article addresses the question: what is the best metric to assess the quality of a reconstructed image? It starts by considering several metrics and selecting a few based on general properties. Then, a variety of image reconstruction cases are considered. The observational scenarios are phase closure and phase referencing at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), for a combination of two, three, four and six telescopes. End-to-end image reconstruction is accomplished with the MIRA software, and several merit functions are put to test. It is found that convolution by an effective point spread function is required for proper image quality assessment. The effective angular resolution of the images is superior to naive expectation based on the maximum frequency sampled by the array. This is due to the prior information used in the aperture synthesis algorithm and to the nature of the objects considered. The l(1)-norm is the most robust of all considered metrics, because being linear it is less sensitive to image smoothing by high regularization levels. For the cases considered, this metric allows the implementation of automatic quality assessment of reconstructed images, with a performance similar to human selection.

"Aims and objectives To assess women's attitudes towards the mechanisms of action of birth control methods. BackgroundWhen addressing women's knowledge of and attitudes towards birth control methods, researchers frequently focus on side effects, effectiveness or correct use. Women's opinions about mechanisms of action have been much less investigated, and research is usually concentrated on the EC pill. DesignCross-sectional study. MethodsWomen, aged 18-49, from Germany, France, the UK, Sweden and Romania were randomly selected (n=1137). They were asked whether they would use a method that may work after fertilisation or after implantation and whether they would continue using it after learning it may have such effects. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the influence of certain characteristics on women's attitudes. ResultsAlmost half of women in Romania and Germany would not use methods with postfertilisation effects, while the lowest percentages were found in Sweden and in France. Regarding methods with postimplantation effects, higher percentages were found in all the countries. Highly educated women and those using a highly effective method were more likely to use methods with postfertilisation effects. On the contrary, married women, those who stated that human life begins at fertilisation and women with middle/high religiosity were less likely to consider using methods that may act after fertilisation. Conclusions One-third of European women reported that they would not consider using a method that may have postfertilisation effects. Relevance to clinical practice Given that postfertilisation effects may not be acceptable to some women, informing them of which methods may have these effects is essential to obtaining complete informed consent and to promoting women's autonomy.

"A type of pneumatic artificial muscle damping seat used in crawler construction vehicle is introduced. When pneumatic artificial muscle works, nonlinear problem happens. This often makes its working performance become worse. Therefore, a self-tuning fuzzy PID controller is used for pneumatic artificial muscle damping seat to decrease this influence. A simplified three degrees of freedom mathematical model of seat-vehicle body-crawler chassis is established. The vibration damping characteristics of the pneumatic artificial muscle seat are obtained using Matlab/Simulink toolbox. Under four different working conditions of crawler construction vehicle, vertical accelerations and displacements are compared between the new pneumatic artificial muscle damping seat and traditional seat. The simulation results show that the pneumatic artificial muscle seat could get better damping properties. To verify the analytical model, experiments were performed on C and G roads. The simulation results show reasonably good agreements with the experimental data. These research results could provide references for further development of pneumatic artificial muscle-type damping seat.

"Africa's population is growing at a faster pace, and the growth in megacities and rate of urbanization has been very rapid. Alongside, economic growth is expected to be very robust in the future. Altogether, these will pose serious challenges for the energy system in Africa; a condition that makes the development of renewables (RES) a necessity in the continent. Though the continent is well-endowed with RES, it is least developed and deployed, partly due to limited research and development in the sector. Particularly, the macroeconomic implications of RES have not been thoroughly studied in the continent, which leaves a big literature gap for the continent. This motivates the current study to investigate into the macroeconomic implications of RES using Ghana as the case study, a country that is Well-endowed with RES and one of the few in the continent that has integrated RES into their overall energy policy. Specifically, in this study, we examined the implications of RES concentration on electricity price uncertainty. Further, we investigated the persistent profile effect of both system-wide and individual shocks on the equilibrium relations. Finally, we decomposed the variance in electricity price into permanent and transitory components and explained what drives these trends. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"As the need for faster power system dynamic simulations increases, it is essential to develop new algorithms that exploit parallel computing to accelerate those simulations. This paper proposes a parallel algorithm based on a two-level, Schur-complement-based, domain decomposition method. The two-level partitioning provides high parallelization potential (coarse- and fine-grained). In addition, due to the Schur-complement approach used to update the sub-domain interface variables, the algorithm exhibits high global convergence rate. Finally, it provides significant numerical and computational acceleration. The algorithm is implemented using the shared-memory parallel programming model, targeting inexpensive multi-core machines. Its performance is reported on a real system as well as on a large test system combining transmission and distribution networks.

"As location-aware applications and location-based services continue to increase in popularity, data sources describing a range of dynamic processes occurring in near real-time over multiple spatial and temporal scales are becoming the norm. At the same time, existing frameworks useful for understanding these dynamic spatio-temporal data, such as time geography, are unable to scale to the high volume, velocity, and variety of these emerging data sources. In this paper, we introduce a computational framework that turns time geography into a scalable analysis tool that can handle large and rapidly changing datasets. The Hierarchical Prism Tree (HPT) is a dynamic data structure for fast queries on spatio-temporal objects based on time geographic principles and theories, which takes advantage of recent advances in moving object databases and computer graphics. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed HPT using two common time geography tasks (finding similar trajectories and mapping potential space-time interactions), taking advantage of open data on space-time vehicle emissions from the EnviroCar platform.

"Bilinear oscillator is a spring-mass system with the spring having different stiffnesses in tension and compression. We analyze the behavior of the bilinear oscillator under a constant preload assuming that the spring has lower stiffness in tension than in compression. We formulate the conditions of the existence of the asymptotics of low stiffness ratios. Under these conditions, the bilinear oscillator can be approximated by an impact oscillator (an oscillator with zero stiffness ratio) under the same preload. In this asymptotics the damping of the stiff (compressive) part is modeled by the introduction of a restitution coefficient. We found that the use of the impact oscillator as an asymptotics of low stiffness ratios is only possible for sufficiently small preloads. We also determined the values of the restitution coefficient that simulate the given damping in the high stiffness region. The relation between the damping and the restitution coefficient is found to be independent of the magnitude of the preload. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Active demand side response (DSR) will provide a significant opportunity to enhance the power system flexibility in the Great Britain (GB). Although electricity peak shaving has a clear reduction on required investments in the power system, the benefits on the gas supply network have not been examined. Using a Combined Gas and Electricity Networks expansion model (CGEN+), the impact of DSR on the electricity and gas supply systems in GB was investigated for the time horizon from 2010 to 2050s. The results showed a significant reduction in the capacity of new gas-fired power plants, caused by electricity peak shaving. The reduction of gas-fired power plants achieved through DSR consequently reduced the requirements for gas import capacity up to 90 million cubic meter per day by 2050. The cost savings resulted from the deployment of DSR over a 50-year time horizon from 2010 was estimated to be around 60 billion for the GB power system. Although, the cost saving achieved in the gas network was not significant, it was shown that the DSR will have a crucial role to play in the improvement of security of gas supply.

"As motion sensors are getting light-weighted and low-priced, there is a growing appetite for the accelerometer-based approaches for efficiently monitoring human activities. This paper proposes an original feature selection approach based on the spectral distances between a given signal and an activity model. This new technique is evaluated and compared to existing techniques in literature. This study also investigates the improvement of classification performances brought by the heart rate (HR) data in addition to the accelerometer data. The experimental dataset is composed of both acceleration and HR recordings from eight volunteers performing five ambulation activities. Four wearable sensor units, including an ECG node are employed. The response of the system to three widely used classifiers, the K-nearest neighbors K-NN, the Naive Bayes NB and the decision Tree C4.5 is reported along with the classification rates. The results reached up to 99% of overall recognition accuracy and higher than 98% using a single-sensor acceleration data and the HR data. These results demonstrate that the spectral distances approach can be adopted to accurately classify activities and that the joint processing of acceleration signals together with the HR signals can increase the classification accuracy compared to the case when processing the acceleration signals alone.

"As networking has become major innovation driver for the Internet of Things as well as Networks on Chips, the need for effective cryptography in hardware is on a steep rise. Both cost and overall system security are the main challenges in many application scenarios, rather than high throughput. In this work we present area-optimized implementations of the lightweight block cipher SIMON. All presented cores are protected against side channel attacks using threshold implementation, which applies secret sharing of different orders to prevent exploitable leakages. Implementation results show that, on FPGAs, the higher-order protected SIMON core can be smaller than an unprotected AES core at the same security level against classic cryptanalysis. Also, the proposed secure cores consume less than 30 percent the power of any unprotected AES. Security of the proposed cores is validated by provable arguments as well as practical t-test based leakage detection methods. In fact, we show that the first-order protected SIMON core does not have first-order leakage and is secure up to 10 million observations against higher-order attacks. The second-order secure implementation could not be exploited at all with up to 100 million observations.

"Aim: Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors are a common treatment strategy for metastatic melanoma and other tumour entities. Clinical trials usually exclude patients with preexisting autoimmune diseases, thus experience with PD-1 inhibitor (PD-li) in this patient population is limited. Patients and methods: Metastatic melanoma patients with preexisting autoimmune disorders or previous ipilimumab-triggered immune-related adverse events (irAE) undergoing treatment with PD-li from seven German skin cancer centres were evaluated retrospectively with regard to flare of the preexisting autoimmunity and development of new, not preexisting irAE as well as response to PD-li therapy. Results: In total, 41 patients had either preexisting autoimmunity (n = 19, group A, including two patients with additional ipilimumab-triggered autoimmune colitis) or ipilimumab-triggered irAE (n = 22, group B). At PD-li therapy initiation, six patients in group A and two patients in group B required immunosuppressive therapy. In group A, a flare of preexisting autoimmune disorders was seen in 42% of patients, new irAE in 16%. In group B, 4.5% of patients showed a flare of ipilimumab-triggered irAE and 23% new irAE. All flares of preexisting autoimmune disorders or irAE were managed by immunosuppressive and/or symptomatic therapy and did not require termination of PD-li therapy. tumour responses (32% in group A and 45% in group B) were unrelated to occurrence of autoimmunity. Conclusion: While preexisting autoimmunity commonly showed a flare during PD-li therapy, a flare of ipilimumab-triggered irAE was rare. Response rates were above 30% and unrelated to irAE. PD-li therapy can be considered in patients with autoimmune disorders depending on severity and activity of autoimmunity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Based on recent findings, the main span of the Vincent Thomas suspension bridge crosses directly over the Palos Verdes fault, which has the capacity to produce a devastating earthquake. In spring 2000, the bridge underwent a major retrofit using visco-elastic dampers. This study focuses on seismic vulnerability of the retrofitted bridge. Three-dimensional memberbased detailed and panel-based simplified finite element models of the bridge are developed. In order to show the appropriateness of these models, eigenproperties of the bridge are evaluated and compared with the system identification results obtained using ambient vibration data. In addition, a model validation is performed by simulating the dynamic response during the 1994 Northridge earthquake and comparing with the measured response. Finally, considering a set of strong ground motions in the Los Angeles area, nonlinear time history analyses are performed and the ductility demands of critical sections are presented in terms of fragility curves. The study shows that a ground motion with peak ground acceleration of 0.9 g or greater will result in plastic hinge formation at one or more locations with a probability of exceedance of 50%. Also, it is found that the effect of dampers is minimal for low to moderate earthquakes and high for strong earthquakes.

Data revealed that students' support needs during computing activities were not CT-specific. Rather, supports specific to these students' needs that were successful in other educational areas were also successful and sufficient in CT. Although additional studies would need to be conducted to ascertain the transferability of these findings to other contexts and students, our results contribute evidence that students with disabilities can and should participate in CT and be provided with the supports they need, just as in all other areas of the curriculum.

Methods: Current drinkers in Canada (n=565) recruited through zoompanel were asked about 13 past year hangover symptoms. These were explored through correlation with alcohol consumption, problems, treatment and other factors. Findings: Increased number of symptoms were associated with higher Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) problem score, perceived harm from drinking, younger age and flushing/blushing when drinking (Mean = 3.3 symptoms). Four patterns were found from latent class analysis; class 4 (43%) no symptoms; class 3 (13%) thirst, tiredness, headache, nausea and vomiting; class 2 (22%) thirst, tiredness and headache; and class 1 (21%) wide range. Class 1 was characterised by blushing when drinking, higher perceived harm and attempts to reduce drinking due to hangovers. Classes 1-3 were associated with heavier consumption; only class 3 compared with class 4 had lower drinking refusal self-efficacy. Conclusions: higher alcohol consumption and lower drinking refusal self-efficacy relate to more symptoms; however, a group with variable alcohol consumption did not experience hangovers.

We present the first study of ARM virtualization performance on server hardware, including multi-core measurements of two popular ARM and x86 hypervisors, KVM and Xen. We show how ARM hardware support for virtualization can enable much faster transitions between VMs and the hypervisor, a key hypervisor operation. However, current hypervisor designs, including both Type 1 hypervisors such as Xen and Type 2 hypervisors such as KVM, are not able to leverage this performance benefit for real application workloads.

"Actuated by spatial universal rotating magnetic vector through digital control, the steering navigation of the spiral-type capsule robot in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract becomes possible. However, as a potential risk, the fluid resistance torsion moment generated by the rotating spiral-type capsule robot would distort the GI tract with insufficient fluid. It is difficult to investigate the fluid distorting effect on the GI tract, because online measurement of the fluid resistance torsion moment still remains unsolved. In this paper, an innovative method employing critical coupling magnetic moment for indirectly detecting the fluid resistance torsion moment is proposed. To reduce fluid distorting effect, a petal-shaped capsule robot, whose surface is composed of four petal-shaped tiles, is proposed, and fluid resistance torsion moment-weaken effect of the petal-shaped capsule robot is discovered and investigated, which happens to the fluid when it travels through a convergent wedge-like gap between the surface of each of the four petal-shaped tiles and the inner pipe wall. Simulations and experiments have demonstrated that the twist impact on the GI tract by the petal-shaped capsule robot is reduced, while the non-contact driving performance in the GI tract is improved greatly isolated by fluid membrane with high dynamic pressure.

"Background: The literature has shown good results with partial repairs of large and massive tears of rotator cuff but the role of factors that affect reparability is less clear. The purpose of this study was twofold, 1) to examine clinical outcomes following complete or partial repair of large or massive full-thickness rotator cuff tear, and 2) to explore the value of clinical and surgical factors in predicting reparability. Methods: This was a secondary data analysis of consecutive patients with large or massive rotator cuff tear who required surgical treatment (arthroscopic complete or partial repair) and were followed up for two years. Disability measures included the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), the relative Constant-Murley score (CMS) and the shortened version of the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (ShortWORC). The relationship between predictors and reparability was examined through logistic regressions and chi-square statistics as appropriate. Within group change over time and between group differences in disability outcomes, range of motion and strength were examined by student's T-tests and non-parametric statistics. Results: One hundred and twenty two patients (41 women, 81 men, mean age 64, SD = 9) were included in the analysis. There were 86 large (39 fully reparable, 47 partially reparable) and 36 (10 fully reparable, 26 partially reparable) massive tears. Reparability was not associated with age, sex, or pre-operative active flexion or abduction (p >0.05) but the fully reparable tear group showed a better pre-operative ASES score (p = 0.01) and better active external rotation in neutral (p = 0.01). Reparability was associated with tear shape (p < 0.0001), size (p = 0.002), and tendon quality (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Reparability of large or massive tears is affected by a number of clinical and surgical factors. Patients whose tears could not be fully repaired showed a statistically significant improvement in range of motion, strength and disability at 2 years, although they had slightly inferior results compared to those with complete repairs.

"AIM To prospectively evaluate the postoperative morbimortality and weight loss evolution of patients who underwent a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) as a primary bariatric procedure during 5 years of follow-up. METHODS Since 2006, data from patients undergoing a highly restrictive primary LSG have been prospectively registered in a database and analysed. Preoperative co-morbid conditions, operating time, hospital stay, early and late complications rate and evolution of weight loss after 5 years of follow-up were analysed. RESULTS A total of 156 patients were included, 74.3% of whom were women. The mean age was 43.2 +/- 13.1 years and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 41.5 +/- 7.9 kg/m(2). Seventy patients (44.8%) presented a BMI under 40 kg/m(2). The mortality rate was 0%. The leakage rate was 1.2%, and the total 30-d morbidity rate was 5.1% (8/156). With a mean follow-up of 32.7 +/- 28.5 (range 6-112) mo, the mean percent of excess of weight loss (% EWL) was 82.0 +/- 18.8 at 1 year, 76.7 +/- 21.3 at 3 years and 60.3 +/- 28.9 at 5 years. The mean percent of excess of BMI loss (% EBMIL) was 94.9 +/- 22.4 at 1 year, 89.4 +/- 27.4 at 3 years and 74.8 +/- 29.4 at 5 years. Patients with preoperative BMI less than 40 kg/m(2) achieved greater weight loss than did the overall study population. Diabetes remitted in 75% of the patients and HTA improved in 71.7%. CPAP masks were withdrawn in all patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. CONCLUSION LSG built with a narrow 34 F bougie and starting 3 cm from the pylorus proved to be safe and highly effective in terms of weight loss as a stand-alone procedure, particularly in patients with a preoperative BMI lower than 40 kg/m(2).

"Apply machine learning principles to predict hip fractures and estimate predictor importance in Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-scanned men and women. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry data from two Danish regions between 1996 and 2006 were combined with national Danish patient data to comprise 4722 women and 717 men with 5 years of follow-up time (original cohort n = 6606 men and women). Twenty-four statistical models were built on 75% of data points through k-5, 5-repeat cross-validation, and then validated on the remaining 25% of data points to calculate area under the curve (AUC) and calibrate probability estimates. The best models were retrained with restricted predictor subsets to estimate the best subsets. For women, bootstrap aggregated flexible discriminant analysis (""bagFDA"") performed best with a test AUC of 0.92 [0.89; 0.94] and well-calibrated probabilities following Na < ve Bayes adjustments. A ""bagFDA"" model limited to 11 predictors (among them bone mineral densities (BMD), biochemical glucose measurements, general practitioner and dentist use) achieved a test AUC of 0.91 [0.88; 0.93]. For men, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (""xgbTree"") performed best with a test AUC of 0.89 [0.82; 0.95], but with poor calibration in higher probabilities. A ten predictor subset (BMD, biochemical cholesterol and liver function tests, penicillin use and osteoarthritis diagnoses) achieved a test AUC of 0.86 [0.78; 0.94] using an ""xgbTree"" model. Machine learning can improve hip fracture prediction beyond logistic regression using ensemble models. Compiling data from international cohorts of longer follow-up and performing similar machine learning procedures has the potential to further improve discrimination and calibration.

"Background: Green building systems have proliferated but health outcomes and associated costs and benefits remain poorly understood. Objective: To compare health before and after families moved into new green healthy housing with a control group in traditionally repaired housing. Design and Setting: Mixed methods study in 3 Chicago housing developments. Participants: Public housing and low-income subsidized households (n = 325 apartments with 803 individuals). Main Outcome Measures: Self-reported health status, visual assessment of housing condition, indoor air sampling, and Medicaid expenditure and diagnostic data. Medicaid expenditures and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes were modeled using a generalized linear model with. distribution and log-link. Results: Housing conditions and self-reported physical and mental health improved significantly in the green healthy housing study group compared with both the control group and the dilapidated public housing from which the residents moved, as did hay fever, headaches, sinusitis, angina, and respiratory allergy. Asthma severity measured by self-reported lost school/work days, disturbed sleep, and symptoms improved significantly, as did sadness, nervousness, restlessness, and child behavior. Medicaid data in this exploratory study were inconclusive and inconsistent with self-reported health outcomes and visual assessment data on housing quality but hold promise for future investigation. Possible sources of bias in the Medicaid data include older age in the study group, changes in Medicaid eligibility over time, controlling for Medicaid costs in an urban area, and the increased stress associated with moving, even if the move is into better housing. Conclusion: The mixed method approach employed here describes the complex relationships among self-reported health, housing conditions, environmental measures, and clinical data. Housing conditions and self-reported physical and mental health improved in green healthy housing. Health care cost savings in Medicaid due to improved housing could not be quantified here but hold promise for future investigations with larger cohorts over a longer follow-up period.

"Based on the experimental data from a scaled model of the Liede Bridge in Guangzhou, China, the nonlinear behavior of a self-anchored suspension bridge during the process of structural system transformation has been systematically and comprehensively studied. The variation of main cable deformation, hanger tension, and main girder stress during the transformation process is analyzed, and their relationships with the different states of structural system are studied. The characteristics and distribution patterns of the lateral torsional angle of spatial cable clamps are identified. In this paper, the principles of the two stages of construction control for self-anchored suspension bridges are introduced, and construction control targets and error elimination methods for each stage are also discussed. Based on the measured results of an in situ static load test, the response characteristics of main cable axial deformation, hanger tension, and deflection stress of the main girder are described under the most unfavorable unbalanced loading case. The effects induced by the secondary dead and live load are obtained by a linear analysis procedure according to the accumulative theory. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

"Aim: The aim of this study was to test the psychometric properties of the Salutogenic Health Indicator Scale (SHIS) in an adolescent population. Methods: The investigation was performed among Swedish students aged 13-15 years (n = 817; 58% girls). The SHIS was assessed for respondent acceptability, and its psychometric properties were evaluated according to classical test theory (regarding unidimensionality, targeting, reliability, and external construct validity). Results: The adolescents found it easy to complete the questionnaire, which was completed in an average of 4 minutes. Exploratory factor analysis, which is based on polychoric correlations, identified one factor, supporting the instrument's unidimensionality. Floor/ceiling effects were 3.3%. Reliability estimates yielded a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.93; the test-retest reliability (n = 50; 2-week interval) coefficients were 0.89 for the total SHIS score and 0.52-0.79 for item scores. Spearman correlations with other variables were based on a priori expectations (self-rated general health, 0.595; depressive symptoms, -0.773; anxiety, -0.577; and sleep problems, 0.519). Conclusions: Our observations support both the acceptability and the psychometric properties of the SHIS as a brief, unidimensional assessment tool for salutogenic health in adolescents. Further studies using modern test theory are needed to better understand the measurement properties of the SHIS, including the functioning of its response categories and its comparability between adolescents and adults.

"Aim: Parent-reporting is needed to examine Quality of Life (QoL) of children with cerebral palsy (CP) across all severities. This study examines whether QoL changes between childhood and adolescence, and what predicts adolescent QoL. Method: SPARCLE is a European cohort study of children with CP, randomly sampled from population databases. Of 818 8-12-year-olds joining the study, 594 (73%) were revisited as 13-17-year-olds. The subject of this report is the 551 (316 boys, 235 girls) where. the same parent reported QoL on both occasions using KIDSCREEN-52 (transformed Rasch scale, mean 50, SD 10 per domain). Associations were assessed using linear regression. Results: Between childhood and adolescence, average QoL reduced in six domains (1.3-3.8 points, p <0.01) and was stable in three (Physical wellbeing, Autonomy, Social acceptance). Socio-demographic factors had little predictive value. Childhood QoL was a strong predictor of all domains of adolescent QoL. Severe impairments of motor function, IQ or communication predicted higher adolescent QoL on some domains; except that severe motor impairment predicted lower adolescent QoL on the Autonomy domain. More psychological problems and higher parenting stress in childhood and their worsening by adolescence predicted lower QoL in five and eight domains respectively; contemporaneous pain in seven domains. The final model explained 30%-40% of variance in QoL, depending on domain. Interpretation: In general, impairment severity and socio-demographic factors were not predictors of lower adolescent QoL. However, pain, psychological problems and parenting stress were predictors of lower adolescent QoL in most domains. These are modifiable factors and addressing them may improve adolescent QoL.

"Based on fuzzy decision theory, multi objective fuzzy optimization is done for the dynamic isolation model scheme of self-anchored cable-stayed suspension bridge. Using two comparison theory solves the problem of quantifying the qualitative indexes and distinguish the concepts of importance and superiority. Combining the fuzzy decision method with engineering practice and using the results of five cases are proposed for multi objective fuzzy optimization. Comparison results show that it is more reasonable to place lead rubber bearings not only between pier and girder, but also main tower and girder, with viscous dampers between main tower and girder on the same time. This method can provide a reference for structure selection in practical conceptual design phase.

"Aims and objectives. To explore emergency nurses' perceptions of the feasibility and utility of Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia tool in people over 65 with cognitive impairment. The Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia tool was then compared with The Abbey Pain Scale, Doloplus-2 and PACSLAC. The objective was to determine which observational pain assessment tool was the most appropriate for the emergency department context and the cognitively impaired older person. Background. The number of older people with cognitive impairment conditions, such as dementia, presenting to the emergency department is increasing. Approximately 28% of people over 65 years who present will have cognitive impairment. Older people with cognitive impairment often receive suboptimal pain management in the ED. There is limited evidence of the use and/or appropriateness of dementia-specific pain observation assessment tools in the ED. Design. This was a multicentre exploratory qualitative study, which was conducted within a constructivist paradigm. Methods. Focus group interviews were conducted with nurses across three hospital emergency departments. Data were subject to thematic analysis. Results. Six focus groups were conducted with 36 nurses over a 12-week period. Four themes emerged from the analysis: 1) cognitive impairment is a barrier to pain management; 2) PAINAD gives structure to pain assessment; 3) PAINAD assists to convey pain intensity; and 4) selection of an appropriate observational pain assessment tool. Conclusions. This study identified that emergency nurses find it challenging to detect, assess and manage pain in cognitively impaired people. While the use of the PAINAD helped to address these challenges compared to other tools, nurses also identified the important role that family and carers can play in pain assessment and management for older people with cognitive impairment. Relevance to clinical practice. This study has generated new knowledge that has broad application across clinical settings, which can assist to transform pain management practice and reduce human suffering. The use of an observational pain assessment tool can provide for greater practice consistency for patients with communication difficulties. Pain management for older people with cognitive impairment is best achieved by the use an appropriate observational pain assessment tool and with a multidisciplinary approach that includes the person and their family/carer.

"Background: Legionella spp. employ multiple strategies to adapt to stressful environments including the proliferation in protective biofilms and the ability to form associations with free-living amoeba (FLA). The aim of the current study was to identify Legionella spp., Acanthamoeba spp., Vermamoeba (Hartmannella) vermiformis and Naegleria fowleri that persist in a harvested rainwater and solar pasteurization treatment system. Methods: Pasteurized (45 degrees C, 65 degrees C, 68 degrees C, 74 degrees C, 84 degrees C and 93 degrees C) and unpasteurized tank water samples were screened for Legionella spp. and the heterotrophic plate count was enumerated. Additionally, ethidium monoazide quantitative polymerase chain reaction (EMA-qPCR) was utilized for the quantification of viable Legionella spp., Acanthamoeba spp., V. vermiformis and N. fowleri in pasteurized (68 degrees C, 74 degrees C, 84 degrees C and 93 degrees C) and unpasteurized tank water samples, respectively. Results: Of the 82 Legionella spp. isolated from unpasteurized tank water samples, Legionella longbeachae (35 %) was the most frequently isolated, followed by Legionella norrlandica (27 %) and Legionella rowbothamii (4 %). Additionally, a positive correlation was recorded between the heterotrophic plate count vs. the number of Legionella spp. detected (rho = 0.710, P = 0.048) and the heterotrophic plate count vs. the number of Legionella spp. isolated (rho = 0.779, P = 0.0028) from the tank water samples collected. Solar pasteurization was effective in reducing the gene copies of viable V. vermiformis (3-log) and N. fowleri (5-log) to below the lower limit of detection at temperatures of 68-93 degrees C and 74-93 degrees C, respectively. Conversely, while the gene copies of viable Legionella and Acanthamoeba were significantly reduced by 2-logs (P = 0.0024) and 1-log (P = 0.0015) overall, respectively, both organisms were still detected after pasteurization at 93 degrees C. Conclusions: Results from this study indicate that Acanthamoeba spp. primarily acts as the vector and aids in the survival of Legionella spp. in the solar pasteurized rainwater as both organisms were detected and were viable at high temperatures (68-93 degrees C).

"As the demand for textile products and synthetic dyes increases with the growing global population, textile dye wastewater is becoming one of the most significant water pollution contributors. Azo dyes represent 70% of dyes used worldwide, and are hence a significant contributor to textile waste. In this work, the removal of a reactive azo dye (Reactive Orange 16) from water by adsorption with chitosan grafted poly(poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (CTS-GMA-g-PPEGMA) was investigated. The chitosan (CTS) was first functionalized with glycidyl methacrylate and then grafted with poly(poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) using a nitroxide-mediated polymerization grafting to approach. Equilibrium adsorption experiments were carried out at different initial dye concentrations and were successfully fitted to the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm models. Adsorption isotherms showed maximum adsorption capacities of CTS-g-GMA-PPEGMA and chitosan of 200 mg/g and 150 mg/g, respectively, while the Langmuir equations estimated 232 mg/g and 194 mg/g, respectively. The fundamental assumptions underlying the Langmuir model may not be applicable for azo dye adsorption, which could explain the difference. The Freundlich isotherm parameters, n and K, were determined to be 2.18 and 17.7 for CTS-g-GMA-PPEGMA and 0.14 and 2.11 for chitosan, respectively. An n value between one and ten generally indicates favorable adsorption. The adsorption capacities of a chitosan-PPEGMA 50/50 physical mixture and pure PPEGMA were also investigated, and both exhibited significantly lower adsorption capacities than pure chitosan. In this work, CTS-g-GMA-PPEGMA proved to be more effective than its parent chitosan, with a 33% increase in adsorption capacity.

"A systematic method for designing log-domain wave filters is presented. Wave filters simulate topologically And functionally passive double terminated LC ladder prototype filters of low sensitivity. The design in the log-domain is based on a transposition of the signal flow graph (SFG) that corresponds to the wave equivalent of elementary two-port blocks in the linear domain, to the corresponding log-domain SFG. This is achieved by using an appropriate set of complementary operators, in order to preserve the linear operation of the whole circuit. Simulation results of a fifth-order low-pass and a fourth-order bandpass log-domain wave filter are given, using HSPICE. The proposed circuits are suitable for low-voltage operation and in high-frequency applications.

Then, a complete ATmega1281-based microcontroller platform has been described for performing computational tasks of signal processing and wireless transmission. In the next section remarks have been provided regarding the basic signal processing rules beginning with raw voltage samples of converted optical signals, their acquisition, storage and smoothing. This chapter ends with practical remarks demonstrating an exponential dependence between the minimum measurable heart rate and the readout resolution at different sampling frequencies for different cases of averaging depth (in bits). The following section is devoted strictly to the heart rate and hemoglobin oxygenation (saturation) measurement with the use of the presented platform, referenced to measurements obtained with a stationary certified pulsoxymeter.

"As one of the most reliable technologies, network intrusion detection system (NIDS) allows the monitoring of incoming and outgoing traffic to identify unauthorised usage and mishandling of attackers in computer network systems. To this extent, this paper investigates the experimental performance of Snort-based NIDS (S-NIDS) in a practical network with the latest technology in various network scenarios including high data speed and/or heavy traffic and/or large packet size. An effective testbed is designed based on Snort using different muti-core processors, e.g., i5 and i7, with different operating systems, e.g., Windows 7, Windows Server and Linux. Furthermore, considering an enterprise network consisting of multiple virtual local area networks (VLANs), a centralised parallel S-NIDS (CPS-NIDS) is proposed with the support of a centralised database server to deal with high data speed and heavy traffic. Experimental evaluation is carried out for each network configuration to evaluate the performance of the S-NIDS in different network scenarios as well as validating the effectiveness of the proposed CPS-NIDS. In particular, by analysing packet analysis efficiency, an improved performance of up to 10% is shown to be achieved with Linux over other operating systems, while up to 8% of improved performance can be achieved with i7 over i5 processors.

"Batch adsorption experiments were carried out for the removal of methylene blue (MB) cationic dye from aqueous solution using organic/inorganic hydrogel nanocomposite of titania incorporated sodium alginate crosslinked polyacrylic acid (SA-cl-poly(AA)-TiO2). The hydrogel was prepared by graft copolymerization of acrylic acid (AA) onto sodium alginate (SA) biopolymer in the presence of a crosslinking agent, a free radical initiator and TiO2 nanoparticles. The hydrogel exhibited a high swelling capacity of 412.98 g/g. The factors influencing adsorption capacity of the absorbents such as pH of the dye solutions, initial concentration of the dye, amount of absorbents, and temperature were investigated and used to propose a possible mechanism of adsorption. The adsorption process concurs with a pseudo-second-order kinetics and with Langmuir isotherm equation. A very high adsorption capacity (Q(max) = 2257.36 (mg/g)) and a correlation coefficient of 0.998 calculated from isotherm equations show the high efficiency of the absorbent and thus expected to be a good candidate as an absorbent for water treatment.

"Biodiversity mapping in African savannah is important for monitoring changes and ensuring sustainable use of ecosystem resources. Biodiversity mapping can benefit from multi-spectral instruments such as WorldView-2 with very high spatial resolution and a spectral configuration encompassing important spectral regions not previously available for vegetation mapping. This study investigated i) the benefits of the eight-band WorldView-2 (WV-2) spectral configuration for discriminating tree species in Southern African savannah and ii) if multiple-images acquired at key points of the typical phenological development of savannahs (peak productivity, transition to senescence) improve on tree species classifications. We first assessed the discriminatory power of WV-2 bands using interspecies-Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) via Band Add-On procedure and tested the spectral capability of WorldView-2 against simulated IKONOS for tree species classification. The results from interspecies-SAM procedure identified the yellow and red bands as the most statistically significant bands (p = 0.000251 and p = 0.000039 respectively) in the discriminatory power of WV-2 during the transition from wet to dry season (April). Using Random Forest classifier, the classification scenarios investigated showed that i) the 8-bands of the WV-2 sensor achieved higher classification accuracy for the April date (transition from wet to dry season, senescence) compared to the March date (peak productivity season) ii) the WV-2 spectral configuration systematically outperformed the IKONOS sensor spectral configuration and iii) the multi-temporal approach (March and April combined) improved the discrimination of tress species and produced the highest overall accuracy results at 80.4%. Consistent with the interspecies-SAM procedure, the yellow (605 nm) band also showed a statistically significant contribution in the improved classification accuracy from WV-2. These results highlight the mapping opportunities presented by WV-2 data for monitoring the distribution status of e.g. species often harvested by local communities (e.g. Sclerocharya birrea), encroaching species, or species-specific tree losses induced by elephants.

"Aims and objectives. To describe perceived social support among patients with coronary heart disease following percutaneous coronary intervention. Background. A low level of social support is considered a risk factor for coronary heart disease in healthy individuals and reduces the likelihood that people diagnosed with coronary heart disease will have a good prognosis. Design. A descriptive cross-sectional study. Methods. A survey of 416 patients was conducted in 2013. A self-report instrument, Social Support of People with Coronary Heart Disease, was used. The instrument comprises three dimensions of social support: informational, emotional, functional supports and 16 background variables. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, factor analysis, mean sum variables and multivariate logistic regression. Results. Perceived informational support was primarily high, but respondents' risk factors were not at the target level. The weakest items of informational support were advice on physical activity, continuum of care and rehabilitation. Regarding the items of emotional support, support from other cardiac patients was the weakest. The weakest item of functional support was respondents' sense of the healthcare professionals' care of patients coping with their disease. Background variables associated with perceived social support were gender, marital status, level of formal education, profession, physical activity, duration of coronary heart disease and previous myocardial infarction. Conclusions. Healthcare professionals should pay extra attention to women, single patients, physically inactive patients, those demonstrating a lower level of education, those with a longer duration of CHD, and respondents without previous acute myocardial infarction. Continuum of care and counselling are important to ensure especially among them. Relevance to clinical practice. This study provides evidence that healthcare professionals should be more aware of the individual needs for social support among patients with coronary heart disease after percutaneous coronary intervention.

"Aim: To investigate whether phase II cardiac rehabilitation (CR) conducted by a community model of shared care CR (SC-CR) including health care centres and general practice was feasible and provided acceptable results and to compare SC-CR to hospital-based CR (H-CR) in a randomised controlled trial. Methods: Patients were randomised to H-CR or SC-CR after admission for acute coronary syndrome. In SC-CR, the general practitioner took over the responsibility of the remaining rehabilitation, pharmacological treatment and risk factor management after the initial visit to the hospital outpatient clinic. The Municipal Health Care Centres provided courses on smoking cessation, nutrition, and exercise training and contributed to disease education and psychosocial support. The main endpoint was adherence to the CR programme and compliance with lifestyle modifications. Results: In total, 1364 patients were screened, 327 (24%) were eligible, and 212 (65%) accepted participation. Phase II CR was completed by 192 (91%) of the participants. Full adherence to the CR programme was seen in 53% in SC-CR versus 54% in H-CR (relative risk (RR): 0.98, 95% confidence interval: 0.73-1.32). In H-CR, patients had higher rates of adherence to dietary advice and health education. In SC-CR, 12% of patients did not attend the risk factor evaluation and clinical assessment with their general practitioner. No difference in risk factor improvement was found. Exercise training was declined by 25% in both groups. Conclusion: Adherence to phase II CR was high in both groups. SC-CR did not improve adherence and efficacy, but had comparable effects on medication and risk factors. Thus, SC-CR was safe and effective.

"A symbolic macromodel for slew and settling characterization of fully differential switched-capacitor (SC) integrators is proposed in this work. This model is intended for fast behavioral simulation of data converters in the time-domain. The main advantages of the proposed model are: 1) it can be created automatically without the need of running a transient simulation; 2) it is fully composed of circuit elements that can be simulated by SPICE or MATLAB; 3) it is created in symbolic form so that adjustment of the transistor-level circuit is directly reflected in the macromodel without the need of remodeling. The proposed modeling methodology is validated by applying to SC integrators implemented by two different operational amplifiers. The step response waveforms of the integrator model have good agreement to the transistor-level simulation results with a speedup of about 20x.

"Because of the reducing number of satellite images with various periods and good quality caused not only by changes in climate conditions, but also typhoons, rainy seasons, and various atmospheric changes, continuous image production and identification of changes in biophysical characteristics have become increasingly difficult. To remedy this, the production of simulated image that consider user-preferred periods and satellite geometric information can be one of alternatives. In this study, a simulated image generation method that uses the back project under collinearity conditions and atmospheric simulation is proposed. To create input data for the generation of simulated image, we produced SPOT-4 HRVIR satellite image that geometric and atmospheric corrections are processed. The analysis results on the similarity between simulated image and target image show average R-2 of 0.88. In addition, the experimental results for each image application field showed that (1) in the case of natural color composite, pixels having a correlation coefficient greater than 0.99 occupied 98% of the total image, (2) the results of the NDVI, an index frequently used in the forestry field, showed that the R-2 of two images was 0.91, and (3) the results of a similarity analysis showed that, after land cover classification was performed using maximum likelihood classification, an average similarity of 96% per land cover was achieved as compared with the target image. These results verify the similarity between the simulated image and target image, and the applicability of the simulated image.

"Beaver Slide is near 177.8km (110.5mi) on the Dalton Highway and the road gradient is approximately 11%, built on a hill side. Each year, soft spots, also commonly named as frost boils, were observed starting from late April and lasting for the entire summer. The frost boils have resulted in an extremely unsafe driving condition and frequent accident occurrences. Conventional repair methods cannot effectively solve this issue. A newly developed geotextile, which has high specific surface area, was installed in the selected test section to mitigate the frost-boil issue in August 2010. This type of geotextile can provide high wettability and relatively high suction (capillary force), consequently be able to laterally transport water (a high-directional transmissivity) under unsaturated conditions. Test results over the initial 2years had proved the effectiveness of the geotextile to alleviate frost heave and the subsequent thaw-weakening issue. However, there were still some concerns regarding its long-term performance, such as clogging of the microscopic drainage channels and mechanical failures. The data collected during the past 5 years were used to analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of the wicking fabric. A scanning electron microscope was used to explore the interaction between the wicking fabric and in situ soils, and to determine the condition of the fabric 5 years after the installation.

"Automated regulatory and contractual compliance checking requires automated rule extraction from regulatory and contractual textual documents (e.g., contract specifications). Automated rule extraction is a challenging task that requires complex processing of text. In the proposed automated compliance checking (ACC) approach, the first step in automating the rule extraction process is automatically classifying the different documents and parts of documents (e.g., contract clauses) into predefined categories (environmental, safety, health, etc.) for preparing it for further text analysis and rule extraction. These categories are defined in a semantic model for normative reasoning. This paper presents a semantic, machine learning-based text classification algorithm for classifying clauses and subclauses of general conditions for supporting ACC in construction. The multilabel classification problem was transformed into a set of binary classification problems. Different machine learning algorithms, text preprocessing techniques, methods of text feature scoring, methods of feature weighting, and feature sizes were implemented and evaluated at different thresholds. The developed classifier achieved 100 and 96% recall and precision, respectively, on the testing data. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

"As the area of Software Engineering (SE) matures the role of human factors in software development is commonly recognized as important. Increasingly we see empirical studies that investigate the connection between, for example, personalities and preferences, attitudes or performances of software engineers. Statistical analysis holds a key role by providing the means for uncovering associations between various facets of human factors and behavioral effects on projects and outcomes. Traditional statistical techniques tend to explore and interpret the multidimensional personality and behavioral data from an ""average-point"" perspective, targeting central trends. This paper introduces a methodology with statistical tools that can provide a new and different perspective for this type of SE data. It seeks the boundaries of a psychometric dataset and discovers reference or ""benchmark"" personalities, the archetypal personalities. Then, the method examines the placement of all individuals in the dataset in relation to the archetypes. Furthermore, the SE preference characteristics, or generally, any other types of behavioral SE data, are analyzed with respect to the archetypes. As a case to exemplify the methodology we analyze personality and project preference data from 276 master level SE students and compare to previous ""average-point"" statistical analysis of the same data. We also discuss how Archetypal Analysis, the heart of the proposed methodology, combined with multi-correspondence analysis might be of general use in empirical SE.

"Approximate adders are widely being advocated as a means to achieve performance gain in error resilient applications. In this paper, a generic methodology for analytical modeling of probability of occurrence of error and the Probability Mass Function (PMF) of error value in a selected class of approximate adders is presented, which can serve as performance metrics for the comparative analysis of various adders and their configurations. The proposed model is applicable to approximate adders that comprise of sub-adder units of uniform as well as non-uniform lengths. Using a systematic methodology, we derive closed form expressions for the probability of error for a number of state-of-the-art high-performance approximate adders. The probabilistic analysis is carried out for arbitrary input distributions. It can be used to study the dependence of error statistics in an adder's output on its configuration and input distribution. Moreover, it is shown that by building upon the proposed error model, we can estimate the probability of error in circuits with multiple approximate adders. We also demonstrate that, using the proposed analysis, the comparative performance of different approximate adders can be correctly predicted in practical applications of image processing.

Material and methods: Twenty-five neonates that required ECLS in between November 2010 and November 2015 were evaluated. Results: The median age was 12 days (range 3-28 days) and the median body weight was 3kg (range 2.5-5kg). Venoarterial ECLS was performed in all of the cases. Ascendan aorta-right atrial cannulation in 22 patients and neck cannulation in three patients were performed. The reason for ECLS was E-CPR in two patients, inability to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in seven patients, respiratory insufficiency and hypoxia in nine patients, low cardiac output (LCOS) in seven patients. Median duration of ECLS was four days (range 1-15). Hemorrhagic complications developed in 15, renal complications in 13, pulmonary complications in 12, infectious complications in 11, neurologic complications in three and mechanical complications in two of the patients. Weaning was successful in 15 of the patients. Eleven patients were successfully discharged. Conclusion: ECLS is an important treatment option that is performed successfully in many centers around the world to maintain life support in patients unresponsive to medical treatment. The utilization of this modality especially in newborns with congenital heart disease should be taken into consideration.

"Aim: To describe treatment pattern, complications, and direct medical costs associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in Chinese urban patients. Methods: The 2013 China Health Insurance Research Association (CHIRA) urban insurance claims database was used to identify patients with AS. The identified patients were stratified by AS treatments for the comparisons of well established AS-related complications and direct medical costs. Conventional regression analyses adjusted the collected patient baseline characteristics to confirm the impact of treatments on complications and direct medical costs. Results: Of the identified 1299 patients with AS, 18.0% received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), 11.2% received immunosuppressant, 48.2% received NSAID plus immunosuppressant, 4.6% received biologic agents, and 17.9% received medications without indication for AS. Biologic group was associated with the lowest proportion of AS-related complications (8.3%) that was confirmed by multiple logistic regression analysis (odds ratio = 0.200, p=.017). The biologic group was also associated with highest direct medical costs (median: RMB=14,539) that were confirmed by the multiple generalized linear model (coefficient = 1.644, p<.001). Conclusions: Biologics were not commonly used for AS in Chinese patients likely due to their high cost. Future studies are needed to confirm the potential long-term clinical benefits associated biologic treatment for AS.

"A systematic and unified method using the signal how graph (SFG) technique if presented in analyzing de-de pulsewidth modulated (PWM) switch mode power converters (SMPC's) operating in the continuous conduction mode (CCM). Loop gains for single and multiloop systems are reviewed. The SFG of the converter is then generated from the perturbed state-space averaged (SSA) equations, and the characteristic polynomial of the system is computed. By grouping terms associated with the gain of the error amplifier as the numerator, a unique definition of system loop gain is introduced, and locations for breaking the loop are discussed. System loop gains for both voltage- and current-programming converters with either trailing- or leading-edge modulation are derived. It is shown that for a SMPC, the loop gain measured by an analog injection method is the system loop gain, which determines the stability of the converter.

"A structure under damage normally exhibits nonlinear dynamic behaviors and time-dependent stiffness and damping. By estimating instantaneous dynamic characteristics of a structures is generally very useful when assessing structural damage in real application. This study presents a novel and effective approach that accurately estimating instantaneous dynamic characteristic of a structure using time-varying autoregressive exogenous (TVARX) model on Gabor frame. To evaluate the time-varying coefficient matrices of a time-series model, the proposed procedure applies Gaussian-based weighted function and Fourier transform on time series model, then the Gabor-transform-based time series formula could be obtained. The dynamic characteristics of a structure are determined from the coefficient matrices. Numerical analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to traditional time-frequency analysis in accurately estimating instantaneous dynamic characteristics of a structure. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to process measured data for a steel frame specimen subjected to a series of base excitations in shaking table tests.

"A triaxial force-sensitive microrobot was developed to dynamically perturb skin in multiple deformation modes, in vivo. Wiener static nonlinear identification was used to extract the linear dynamics and static nonlinearity of the force-displacement behavior of skin. Stochastic input forces were applied to the volar forearm and thenar eminence of the hand, producing probe tip perturbations in indentation and tangential extension. Wiener static nonlinear approaches reproduced the resulting displacements with variances accounted for (VAF) ranging 94-97%, indicating a good fit to the data. These approaches provided VAF improvements of 0.1-3.4% over linear models. Thenar eminence stiffness measures were approximately twice those measured on the forearm. Damping was shown to be significantly higher on the palm, whereas the perturbed mass typically was lower. Coefficients of variation (CVs) for nonlinear parameters were assessed within and across individuals. Individual CVs ranged from 2% to 11% for indentation and from 2% to 19% for extension. Stochastic perturbations with incrementally increasing mean amplitudes were applied to the same test areas. Differences between full-scale and incremental reduced-scale perturbations were investigated. Different incremental preloading schemes were investigated. However, no significant difference in parameters was found between different incremental preloading schemes. Incremental schemes provided depth-dependent estimates of stiffness and damping, ranging from 300 N/m and 2 Ns/m, respectively, at the surface to 5 kN/m and 50 Ns/m at greater depths. The device and techniques used in this research have potential applications in areas, such as evaluating skincare products, assessing skin hydration, or analyzing wound healing.

"Aim. There is a longstanding debate over the long-term effect of intensive endurance training on cardiac function. Usually, echocardiography has been used as a global evaluation of left ventricular (LV) or right ventricular (RV) function and dimensions. Recently, speckle tracking strain (ST) has provided an analysis of regional RV and LV function. Thus, the intention of the study was to carefully evaluate cardiac function in a group of former world class swimmers applying longitudinal strain (LS) and circumferential strain (CS) analysis. Methods. Twelve athletes (45 +/- 1.5 years) of a former training group involved in high intensity endurance training were examined 24.9 +/- 4.3 years after the end of their active swimming career. An echocardiography was performed and LV function was analyzed based on CS and LS. Also, LS was evaluated for the RV. All measurements were performed for epicardium and endocardium independently. Results. Mean LV endocardial LS was -20.0 +/- 6.3 and epicardial LS -20.2 +/- 6.2. LV endocardial CS was -21.3 +/- 8.0 and epicardial CS -11.9 +/- 4.2. RV endocardial LS had a mean value of -26.4 +/- 6.1 and epicardial LS of -28.2 +/- 5.6. Conclusion. Twenty-five years after the cessation of endurance training, there was no evidence of a deterioration of RV or LV function as values for RV and LV strain measurements were within normal ranges.

"As the volumes of spatiotemporal trajectory data continue to grow at a rapid pace; a new generation of data management techniques is needed in order to be able to utilize these data to provide a range of data-driven services, including geographic-type services. Key challenges posed by spatiotemporal data include the massive data volumes, the high velocity with which the data are captured, the need for interactive response times, and the inherent inaccuracy of the data. We propose an infrastructure, Elite, that leverages peer-to-peer and parallel computing techniques to address these challenges. The infrastructure offers efficient, parallel update and query processing by organizing the data into a layered index structure that is logically centralized, but physically distributed among computing nodes. The infrastructure is elastic with respect to storage, meaning that it adapts to fluctuations in the storage volume, and with respect to computation, meaning that the degree of parallelism can be adapted to best match the computational requirements. Further, the infrastructure offers advanced functionality, including probabilistic simulations, for contending with the inaccuracy of the underlying data in query processing. Extensive empirical studies offer insight into properties of the infrastructure and indicate that it meets its design goals, thus enabling the effective management of big spatiotemporal data.

"BIM (Building Information Modeling), chiefly in the form of a 3D ""as-built"" model or information-sharing platform, has emerged as a powerful solution to the dynamic requirements of AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction). However, whereas fast and accurate reconstruction of building interiors is essential to any collaborative construction management process, manual creation and utilization of a 3D as-built model typically results in low productivity and erroneous modeling results. This paper proposes a semi-automated method that accounts for and resolves the major problems in the streamlined manual process of 3D as-built model creation in BIM. The method generates a 3D wireframe model combined with clutter data, which is then imported into a BIM tool for as-built modeling. The present study evaluates the proposed method by applying it to two typical rooms in a test building. The 3D as-built model was then subjected to an accuracy assessment using reference points acquired by a total station. The contributions of the proposed method, as compared with fully manual operation, are: (1) reduction of the huge data size of the original point clouds; (2) improvement of the productivity of as-built BIM creation with the aid of 3D wireframes; and (3) accuracy enhancement through a refinement process that entails segmentation and regularization. However, the proposed method is limited to building interiors consisting of planar structures; the modeling of detailed objects, such as windows and doors, unfortunately, still requires manual operation. Thus, further research on detail modeling and refinement is necessary in order to increase the method's automation and enhancement of its overall suitability for mapping complex indoor environments.

In this work we demonstrate a robust, low cost platform for isothermal nucleic acid amplification on a microfluidic device. Using easily obtainable materials and commercial off-the-shelf components, we show real time fluorescence detection using a low cost photodiode and operational amplifier without need for lenses. Temperature regulation on the device is achieved using a heater fabricated with standard printed circuit board fabrication methods.

"A split-parallel hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) is a particular sub-type of the HEV in which the internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric motor provide propulsion power to different axles. Due to the coupling of power through the vehicle itself, its wheels and the road on which it moves rather than through some mechanical device the vehicle is referred to as a 'through-the-road' (TTR) hybrid. A variant of the TTR hybrid has motors in the hub of the otherwise non-driven wheels, called in-wheel motors (IWM). This configuration enables an existing vehicle to be converted into a hybrid vehicle with minimal modification. The present work identifies specific operating modes and power flow of the TTR-IWM hybrid, specifically a retrofit-conversion hybrid, in comparison to the ordinary parallel hybrid vehicle. It discusses control architecture, control objectives and system parameters, along with specific control issues of the retrofit TTR-IWM hybrid vehicle.

"A very promising concept for small range extenders (peak power less than 40 kW) is represented by the 2-stroke, direct injection spark ignition engine, with scavenging and exhaust ports controlled by the piston, and an external pump. The most important issue to be addressed on this type of engines is the compliance with stringent rules on pollutant emissions, which depends on combustion patterns and the quality of the scavenging process. The latter is generally hindered by the symmetry of ports timings, but this handicap can be canceled by adopting a patented rotary valve, controlling the flow through a set of auxiliary transfer ports, and using a piston pump for delivering air to the power cylinder and enhancing the balance of the crankshaft. The paper reviews the design of a virtual engine, rated at 35 kW at 5600 rpm, and developed according to the above mentioned concepts. Design has been driven by CFD simulation, using, whenever possible, experimentally calibrated numerical models, or experimental information derived from similar projects. Particular care has been devoted to characterize the scavenging process and the flow patterns within the cylinder and through the ports, analyzing the influence of the rotary induction valve. Engine performance parameters have been predicted by using a well-established commercial software (GT-Power, by Gamma Technologies), while CFD-3D analyses have been carried out by means of a customized version of the KIVA-3V code. The whole study is conceived as the basis for the construction of a physical prototype. The power target has been virtually achieved with a very light and compact engine (estimated weight without the close-coupled electric motor: 35 kg). A three-way catalyst allows the engine to comply with the most stringent emission regulations, without relevant penalizations on fuel efficiency. Furthermore, the engine can work with lean mixtures, achieving a minimum specific fuel consumption comparable to a current automotive Diesel engine (223 g/kWh). This excellent result is due to the low friction and pumping losses of the 2-Stroke engine, as well as to the compactness of the combustion chamber and the capability to stratify the charge.

"as the deceleration of processor scaling due to Moore's law accelerates research in new types of computing structures, the need arises for rethinking operating systems paradigms. Traditionally, an operating system is a layer between hardware and applications and its primary function is in managing hardware resources and providing a common abstraction to applications. How does this function apply, however, to new types of computing paradigms? Are operating systems even needed for these new structures? This paper revisits operating system functionality for new computing paradigms. The structure of these new computers is uncertain as there are many possibilities such as neuromorphic, bio-inspired, adiabatic, reversible, approximate, quantum, combinations of these and others unforeseen [1]. We do know, however, that whatever these new computers will be, there will be some need to manage their resources, to provide programming support, to partition, scale, and connect them and to deal with (partial) failure, along with other traditional operating system's functionality. There might also be some new functionality, such as creating abstract control loops, reasoning about precision, new ways of reconfiguring, and more. We strongly believe that even if traditional operating systems functionality evolves, that the need for operating systems will remain in the new era of computing.

"Aims and objectives. To examine the perspectives of health professionals of different disciplines about clinical handover. Background. Ineffective handovers can cause major problems relating to the lack of delivery of appropriate care. Design. A prospective, cross-sectional design was conducted using a survey about clinical handover practices. Methods. Health professionals employed in public metropolitan hospitals, public rural hospitals and community health centres were involved. The sample comprised doctors, nurses and allied health professionals, including physiotherapists, social workers, pharmacists, dieticians and midwives employed in Western Australia, New South Wales, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. The survey sought information about health professionals' experiences about clinical handover; their perceived effectiveness of clinical handover; involvement of patients and family members; health professionals' ability to confirm understanding and to clarify clinical information; role modelling behaviour of health professionals; training needs; adverse events encountered and possibilities for improvements. Results. In all, 707 health professionals participated (response rate = 14%). Represented professions were nursing (60%), medicine (22%) and allied health (18%). Many health professionals reported being aware of adverse events where they noticed poor handover was a significant cause. Differences existed between health professions in terms of how effectively they gave handover, perceived effectiveness of bedside handover vs. nonbedside handover, patient and family involvement in handover, respondents' confirmation of understanding handover from their perspective, their observation of senior health professionals giving feedback to junior health professionals, awareness of adverse events and severity of adverse events relating to poor handovers. Conclusions. Complex barriers impeded the conduct of effective handovers, including insufficient opportunities for training, lack of role modelling, and lack of confidence and understanding about handover processes.

"Automatic change detection is one of the remote sensing applications that has received an increasing attention during the last years. However, fully automatic solutions reach their limitation; on the one hand, it is difficult to design general decision criteria able to select area of changes for images under various acquisition conditions, and on the other hand, the relevance of changes may differ from one user to another. In this letter, we introduce an alternative change detection method based on relevance feedback. The proposed algorithm is iterative and based on a query and answer model that: 1) asks the user questions about the relevance of his targeted changes and 2) according to these answers, updates change detection results. Our method is also based on a new formulation of canonical correlation analysis (CCA), referred to as context-aware CCA, that learns transformations, which map data from different input spaces (related to multitemporal satellite images) into a common latent space, which is sensitive to relevant changes while being resilient to irrelevant ones. These CCA transformations correspond to the optimum of a particular constrained maximization problem that mixes an alignment term with a context-based regularization criterion. The particularity of this novel CCA approach resides in its ability to exploit spatial geometric context resulting into better performances compared with other CCA approaches, as shown in experiments.

"AimPast hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is considered a risk factor for hepatocarcinogenesis, but the clinicopathological characteristics of non-B non-C hepatocellular carcinoma (NBNC-HCC) excluding past HBV infection have not been investigated. This study aimed to clarify the clinicopathological features of strictly defined NBNC-HCC. MethodsAmong HCC patients who underwent surgical resection at our affiliated hospitals in Nagano prefecture, Japan, between 1996 and 2012, 77 were negative for serum anti-HBV core/surface antibodies in addition to HBV surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody without signs of autoimmune liver disease, Wilson disease, or hemochromatosis. These patients were divided into the alcohol intake-positive group (ethanol intake >20g/day, n=31), non-alcoholic fatty liver group (steatosis >5% and ethanol intake <20g/day, n=30), and cryptogenic group (no ethanol intake or steatosis, n=16). Preoperative clinical parameters, tumor and background liver pathology, and prognosis were analyzed. ResultsAdvanced fibrosis and steatosis were detected in 64% and 60% of all patients, respectively. Approximately 85% of the alcohol intake-positive patients had advanced fibrosis. Non-alcoholic fatty liver HCC subjects had the highest body mass index and prevalence of diabetes, but 30-40% had none to mild fibrosis. The cryptogenic group of HCC patients had the lowest incidence of accompanying hepatic inflammation/fibrosis but the largest tumor size. Recurrence/survival rates were comparable among the groups. ConclusionsLiver fibrosis and steatosis are risk factors of HCC regardless of past HBV infection and ethanol consumption. The present results also indicate the possibility of hepatocarcinogenesis independent of hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, ethanol intake, and past HBV infection.

The potential consequences of this phenomena are examined in the specific circumstances of 'ambient assisted living' as an instantiation of the concept of 'intelligent environment'. This chapter describes the idea of 'ambient assisted living' and looks at some of the possible ways humans may be affected by the prevalence of technology. The general example of assisted healthcare, and the specific example of medication support are used to show that systems are advancing. Moreover, these advancements can lead to problems with both the artificial systems, and the larger systems with which they are involved. In many cases there is a trade-off around having people in the loop, but inevitably they will need to be included for many decision making processes. Keeping a person in the loop might also partially redress problems of Artificial General Intelligence systems. The chapter concludes with reflections on how these considerations can help us to retain the positive aspects whilst avoiding the negative side effects of the hypothetical technological singularity.

"A weighted controller structure for DC-DC converters is proposed to deal with large-signal operations. For wide range variations of input voltage and load conditions of DC-DC converters, we firstly divide the pre-defined global operation space into local subspaces where each local linear compensator is designed for the corresponding subspace, and then all the local linear compensators are weighted into single controller structure. By doing so, the weighted controller can automatically decide which local linear compensator regulates the dynamics of DC-DC converter according to the operation conditions, and thus has the capability of self-adaptation to wide range of operating point variations. Furthermore, the prominent feature underlying the weighted control scheme is also that the nonlinearities of DC-DC converters is easily to be handled by linear compensation approaches that can be easily implemented with analog or digital control circuitries. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this controller structure, a stand-alone DC-DC converter and a cascaded DC-DC converter system are taken as examples by simulation and experimental results.

"A universal high-frequency three-phase electricmotor model to be used in the design process of the electric-motor drive systems is proposed. The model can be combined with the models of the filter, cable, and inverter to form a complete drive system. It allows for a common and differential-mode high-frequency analysis in studying the bearing currents, electromagnetic interference, and overvoltages in the motor windings caused by the high-frequency reflections. The model phase is symmetrical meaning that the beginning and end of each phase are equal and the central part is inserted between them. This enables modeling of both the delta and star-winding connections of the three phases. The equations used to calculate the model parameters are presented. They are based on the common and differential-mode impedance measurements. The model can be simplified when considering only electric-discharge machining bearing currents, as they are affected only by the common-mode states. A simplified model to be used in the delta-winding connection is also presented. The model-calculated common and differential-mode impedances are compared with the impedances measured on a 6.5-kW outer-rotor brushless direct-current motor. This paper ends by providing the obtained simulation and measurement results for the common and differential-mode currents and bearing voltages of the studied three-phase delta-winding-connected electric motor.

"Aim: The aim of this paper is to describe the implementation of a strategic plan, Health Gain for Children and Youth of Central Sydney, over a 10-year period to December 2005. Methods: Descriptive information was obtained from the records and minutes of all relevant committees, interviews with key workers who were involved with the committees, managers and senior health professionals, and from the involvement of the authors throughout the process of the implementation. Results: An implementation steering committee was established to oversee the implementation of the plan. Rather than adopting a uniform approach to assigning responsibility for the implementation of each strategy in the plan or developing specific costs and time frames for each strategy, a more pragmatic, flexible and opportunistic approach was taken. Most of the plan's strategies were implemented over a 7-year time frame using a combination of service reorientation and implementation of new programmes, some of which were funded from sources not anticipated during the development of the plan. Implementation required a dedicated driver, commitment at senior level and participation by many staff at many levels. Outcomes, monitored through data collected at 5-year intervals, revealed positive trends in a number of child and youth health indicators. Conclusions: The successful implementation of the strategic plan required pragmatism, flexibility, opportunism and the commitment and involvement of staff at all organisational levels. It is envisaged that this approach provides a firm base for future evidence-based developments to benefit the health and well-being of children, youth and their families and reduce health inequities.

In this paper, we present a review of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for opinion mining. First, we introduce general NLP techniques which are required for text preprocessing. Second, we investigate the approaches of opinion mining for different levels and situations. Then we introduce comparative opinion mining and deep learning approaches for opinion mining. Opinion summarization and advanced topics are introduced later. Finally, we discuss some challenges and open problems related to opinion mining. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"As the development of sensor and machine learning technologies has progressed, it has become increasingly important to detect patterns from probabilistic data streams. In this paper, we focus on complex event processing based on pattern matching. When we apply pattern matching to probabilistic data streams, numerous matches may be detected at the same time interval because of the uncertainty of data. Although existing methods distinguish between such matches, they may derive inappropriate results when some of the matches correspond to the real-world event that has occurred during the time interval. Thus, we propose two grouping methods for matches. Our methods output groups that indicate the occurrence of complex events during the given time intervals. In this paper, first we describe the definition of groups based on temporal overlap, and propose two grouping algorithms, introducing the notions of complete overlap and single overlap. Then, we propose an efficient approach for calculating the occurrence probabilities of groups by using deterministic finite automata that are generated from the query patterns. Finally, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our methods by applying them to real and synthetic datasets.

"A wavelet transformation-based fuzzy reflex control method is proposed to prevent slip and maintain stable grasping posture for prosthetic hands. A key component of the control method is that the response time from slip detection to slip prevention is very short. The proposed control method mainly includes slip detection, reflex grasping force estimation, and use of a reflex controller. In the slip detection, initial slip information can be rapidly obtained via wavelet transformation as soon as disturbances cause the grasped object to slip. This shortens the response time of the reflex control. The initial slip information can then trigger the reflex control. In the grasping estimation, a reflex force estimation model is presented to estimate a force increment that is used to adjust to the desired force. In the reflex controller, a fuzzy logic controller is adopted to track the desired force. Finally, the proposed control method is applied to control a prosthetic hand with a single degree of freedom. The experimental results show that the proposed control method can adjust the grasping force and effectively prevent slip under disturbances. The time of slip prevention is less than 160 ms.

"Aim. The aim of the study was to examine sports injury pattern and establish cost of injuries in relation to training of 58 competitive badminton players in a Malaysian National Sports School. Methods. This one-year prospective observational study recruited all the 13-16 year old students after obtaining informed consent from their appointed guardian. All participants were requested to report any injuries, which were pain or disabilities that occur within the study period (September 1, 2008 to August 31, 2009) either during training or competition. Injured students were to seek treatment from the researcher(s) who made weekly visits and they were then followed up accordingly until they return to full training. Details and progress of the injuries were documented during each visit. Results. Sixty-three injuries were recorded. Soft tissue sprains/strains were the commonest injury (64%). About one third of the injuries occurred in the lower limb especially the knees and was followed by back injuries; 38% of the injuries did not require training modification, half of these injuries resumed training within one week. Upon full training, half of them were still symptomatic. Injury risk was 57%; injury rate was 0.9 injuries/ player/1000 training hours. Conclusion. Badminton injuries mostly involved the lower limb and almost all overuse injuries occurred in the lower limb. However, badminton injuries as a whole were predominantly sprains and strains, and not overuse in nature as widely believed.

"As the course of computer operating system requires students to understand the interactions between computer systems, users and hardware platform, this paper concentrates on the problem of using the virtualization technology in computer operating system teaching. Particularly, virtualization technology is designed to simulate the real computer hardware environment, and then make the operating system run in a virtual computer environment. Because the virtual machine software can simulate real computer hardware equipment, several operating systems are supported, such as Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Unix etc. The main idea of this paper is to utilize the VMware software in operating system teaching. VMware provides a completely virtualized set of hardware for a specific operating system. Afterwards, we discuss how to design and implement an experimental platform with multiple operating systems based on VMware.

"As an overlay cognitive radio, transform domain communication system (TDCS) has been proposed to support reliable communications with low probability of interception. However, most of research on TDCS assume perfect synchronization to simplify algorithm design. In this paper, we present a low complexity symbol timing offset (STO) and carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation method for practical TDCS applications. By utilizing preamble consisted of multiple identical training sequences, STO can be estimated by the demodulation procedure of cyclic code shift keying (CCSK), in which the circular correlation is performed by utilizing fast Fourier transform (FFT). Thus the estimation procedure is significantly simplified with considerable complexity reduction, which is analyzed and compared to other two conventional methods. The simulation results demonstrates that the proposed STO and CFO estimation scheme is a low complexity solution for TDCS in multipath Rayleigh fading channels with comparable estimation performance in terms of probability of incorrect timing offset and mean-square-error of CFO.

"As the stages of emergency response shift, it is an important task in the early stage of emergency response to handle emergency supply (ES) collection with fuzzy demand and multi-hub ES collection network. Taking into consideration the constraints such as no limit to collection time, capacity constraint to single hubs and different demand levels to be met by collection, this paper aims at establishing a mathematic planning model with two objectives, namely the shortest collection time and the optimal collection cost. In terms of algorithm design, the sequential enumeration method (SEM) was employed to solve the model, for higher iteration efficiency and lower difficulty level of the algorithm. The first step was to find the optimal ES collection time, collection route and allocation program in the direct shipment mode, the hub-and-spoke mode and the mixed mode. Then, the three modes were compared in terms of the collection route planning, the shortest collection time, the shortest collection route and the optimal collection cost of the entire ES collection network. The numerical example showed that compared with the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, the result of SEM is basically the same with that of SA algorithm; however, SEM is simpler, more practical and easier to operate, so that it is of better promotional value.

"Accurate evaluation of soil dynamic properties is essential for seismic response analyses of sites. In a number of studies, site properties have been identified using one-dimensional analyses. Such analyses uncouple the two-dimensional (horizontal) response of soil deposits, which is inherently coupled. This paper presents a system identification technique that takes into account the coupled two-directional response of soil deposits. The technique employs non-parametric estimates of the shear stresses derived from acceleration records provided by a vertical (downhole) array. A multi-yield surface plasticity approach is used to model the multi-dimensional stress-strain relation. The identification technique is first verified using finite elements computational simulations. This technique was then used to assess the coupled response of the Wildlife liquefaction research site (Imperial Valley, California). The identified shear moduli and shear wave velocities were found to be in a very good agreement with those measured in the field using crosshole seismic testing.

"AIM To investigate the clinical implications of infliximab trough levels (IFX-TLs) and antibodies to infliximab (ATI) levels in Crohn's disease (CD) patients in Asian countries. METHODS IFX-TL and ATI level were measured using prospectively collected samples obtained with informed consent from CD patients being treated at Asan Medical Center, South Korea. We analyzed the correlations between IFX-TLs/ATI levels and the clinical activity of CD (quiescent vs active disease) based on the CD activity index, C-reactive protein level, and physician's judgment of patients' clinical status at enrollment. The impact of concomitant immunomodulators was also investigated. RESULTS This study enrolled 138 patients with CD (84 with quiescent and 54 with active disease). In patients with quiescent and active diseases, the median IFX-TLs were 1.423 mu g/mL and 0.163 mu g/mL, respectively (P < 0.001) and the median ATI levels were 8.064 AU/mL and 11.209 AU/mL, respectively (P < 0.001). In the ATI-negative and -positive groups, the median IFX-TLs were 1.415 mu g/mL and 0.141 mu g/mL, respectively (P < 0.001). In patients with and without concomitant immunomodulator use, there were no differences in IFX-TLs (0.632 mu g/mL and 1.150 mu g/mL, respectively; P = 0.274) or ATI levels (8.655 AU/mL and 9.017 AU/mL, respectively; P = 0.083). CONCLUSION IFX-TL/ATI levels were well correlated with the clinical activity in South Korean CD patients. Our findings support the usefulness of IFX-TLs/ATI levels in treating CD patients receiving IFX in clinical practice.

"A space-time kinetics based inverse architecture method is suggested to analyze the reactivity variations associated with power excursions in a generic CANDU reactor. It is intended to provide diagnosis tools to gain enhanced control thereby ensuring safe operation of the plant. A methodology for analyzing the data available from the in core flux detectors and extracting the unknown reactivity coefficients is presented. The proposed system uses a reference model in conjunction with an optimal estimator. The reference model is composed of a state space representation of the space-time dynamics of neutron flux in the core, based on modal expansion approximation, and a time domain optimal estimator filter. We investigated three different estimation techniques based on recursive prediction error method (RPEM), dual extended Kalman filter (DEKF), and joint extended Kalman filter (JEKF). We compared their applicability to the estimation of coolant-void dynamic reactivity in loss-of-coolant accident in a CANDU reactor. The state equations also include the characteristics of the detector responses. The thermal hydraulic models were not included in the calculations. Two different types of detectors are considered in this analysis, the over prompt responsive Platinum detector of the reactor shutdown systems, and the under delayed responsive Vanadium detector of the flux mapping system.

"Areas within an agricultural field in the same season often differ in crop productivity despite having the same cropping history, crop genotype, and management practices. One hypothesis is that abiotic or biotic factors in the soils differ between areas resulting in these productivity differences. In this study, bulk soil samples collected from a high and a low productivity area from within six agronomic fields in Illinois were quantified for abiotic and biotic characteristics. Extracted DNA from these bulk soil samples were shotgun sequenced. While logistic regression analyses resulted in no significant association between crop productivity and the 26 soil characteristics, principal coordinate analysis and constrained correspondence analysis showed crop productivity explained a major proportion of the taxa variance in the bulk soil microbiome. Metagenome-wide association studies (MWAS) identified more Bradyrhizodium and Gammaproteobacteria in higher productivity areas and more actinobacteria, ascomycota, planctomycetales, and Streptophyta in lower productivity areas. Machine learning using a random forest method successfully predicted productivity based on the microbiome composition with the best accuracy of 0.79 at the order level. Our study showed that crop productivity differences were associated with bulk soil microbiome composition and highlighted several nitrogen utility-related taxa. We demonstrated the merit of MWAS and machine learning for the first time in a plant-microbiome study.

Also, access to high bandwidth, extendibility and dynamic management are of critical significance, especially when network devices are vertically integrated. Hence, a set of unique predefined line commands and operating systems or firmware should be used. SDN (software-defined networking) is a structure designed for simplifying and improving network management with high flexibility by splitting control plane and data plane. Thus, network programmability is enhanced which in turn leads to more innovation opportunities.

"AIM To investigate the influence of interferon-free antivirus therapy on lipid profiles in chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (HCV1b) infection. METHODS Interferon-free antiviral agents were used to treat 276 patients with chronic HCV1b infection, and changes in serum lipids of those who achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) were examined. The treatment regimen included 24 wk of daclatasvir plus asunaprevir (DCV + ASV) or 12 wk of sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir (SOF + LDV). SVR was achieved in 121 (85.8%) of 141 patients treated with DCV + ASV and 132 (97.8%) of 135 patients treated with SOF + LDV. In the two patient groups (DCV + ASV-SVR and SOF + LDV-SVR), serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides were measured at baseline during treatment and at 4 and 12 wk after treatment. Then, longitudinal changes in lipid profiles were analyzed. RESULTS Serum levels of TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C were significantly increased throughout the observation period in both the DCV + ASV-SVR and SOF + LDV-SVR groups. During antivirus treatment, the increases in TC and LDL-C were significantly greater in the SOF + LDVSVR group than in the DCV + ASV-SVR group (P < 0.001). At 4 and 12 wk after the therapy, serum levels of TC and LDL-C were similar between the two groups and were significantly greater than those at baseline. Approximately 75%-80% of the increase in TC was derived from an increased LDL-C. In multiple regression analysis, the difference in therapy protocol (DCA + ASV or SOF + LDV) was an independent predictor that was significantly associated with the increase in TC and LDL-C at 4 wk of therapy. CONCLUSION Serum cholesterol significantly increased during SOF + LDV treatment. After treatment, HCV elimination was associated with a similar increase in cholesterol regardless of the therapy protocol.

"Assembling and simultaneously using different types of distributed computing infrastructures (DCI) like Grids and Clouds is an increasingly common situation. Because infrastructures are characterized by different attributes such as price, performance, trust, and greenness, the task scheduling problem becomes more complex and challenging. In this paper we present the design for a fault-tolerant and trust-aware scheduler, which allows to execute Bag-of-Tasks applications on elastic and hybrid DCI, following user defined scheduling strategies. Our approach, named Promethee scheduler, combines a pull-based scheduler with multi-criteria Promethee decision making algorithm. Because multi-criteria scheduling leads to the multiplication of the possible scheduling strategies, we propose SOFT, a methodology that allows to find the optimal scheduling strategies given a set of application requirements. The validation of this method is performed with a simulator that fully implements the Promethee scheduler and recreates an hybrid DCI environment including Internet Desktop Grid, Cloud and Best Effort Grid based on real failure traces. A set of experiments shows that the Promethee scheduler is able to maximize user satisfaction expressed accordingly to three distinct criteria: price, expected completion time and trust, while maximizing the infrastructure useful employment from the resources owner point of view. Finally, we present an optimization which bounds the computation time of the Promethee algorithm, making realistic the possible integration of the scheduler to a wide range of resource management software.

"As the world becomes increasingly urbanized, the need for fresh fruits and vegetables in urban areas grows while the difficulty of bringing these perishable products to these areas also increases. Small-scale agriculture located in urban areas is a highly effective and profitable way to provide these products to communities that are far from extensive commercial agricultural areas. Here we describe how remote sensing can be used with data mining approaches to monitor urban and peri-urban farms within cities in both developed and developing countries. Using very high resolution satellite imagery together with moderate and coarse resolution imagery and information from social media and the web, we analyze the usefulness of different methods to identify farms within urban boundaries in four countries. The analysis shows how a mixed-method approach is necessary in order to identify where urban farming is occurring and to monitor its change through time. Although remote sensing-based vegetation and water indices were useful, without ancillary data they are not effective at remotely mapping the locations of urban farms. However, remote sensing is a good way to monitor vegetation condition in locations where actively managed urban farms are known to exist. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"As the increasing demands of military detection, wireless communication and remote sensing make the spectrum even more crowded, radar sequence design meeting spectral compatibility requirement is a challenging and urgent problem. This study is devoted to designing optimised phase-coded sequences which keep spectral-compatible with the overlaid electromagnetic radiators and at the same time optimise the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). First, an intelligent dynamic spectrum information around the radar system is achieved by a radio environmental map. The information is introduced to form a constrained optimisation process aimed at improving the spectral compatibility and the radar detection performance. Second, the unimodularity requirement is necessary to make full use of transmit power and a similarity constraint is enforced to keep desired ambiguity function feature. Third, to resolve the resulting non-convex optimisation quadratically constrained quadratic problem, a relaxation and a randomisation procedure are applied. Therefore, the technique behaves a polynomial computational complexity. Finally, the performance analysis is given to show its effectiveness in terms of the SINR, the spectral shape, and the resulting auto-correlation function.

Therefore, the main purpose of the present study was to investigate the predictors of the non-pharmacological intervention effect for old veterans with dementia and BPSD. MethodsA total of 141 old veterans with dementia living in two veterans' homes in northern Taiwan were recruited. The participants received an organized non-pharmacological intervention program of physical activity/exercise, music therapy, reality orientation, art therapy, reminiscence therapy and horticultural therapy once every week for 6months. All participants were evaluated by the Barthel Index, Lawton-Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI), and the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia before and after the intervention. Logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with improvement/maintenance of cognition (measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination), and improvement of BPSD (measured by NPI) and its subdomains during the intervention period. ResultsMultivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the improvement/maintenance of cognitive function was independently associated with a lower Mini-Mental State Examination score at baseline (odds ratio [OR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.97, P=0.008), whereas participants with antipsychotic use were less likely to gain the effect (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.17-1.04, P=0.061). In addition, the improvement of BPSD was associated with a higher baseline total NPI score (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.15-1.55, P<0.001), and the result was consistent in different NPI subdomains (psychotic domain: OR 1.96, 95% CI 0.83-4.58, P=0.123; affective domain: OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.25-2.13, P<0.001; behavior domain: OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.53-3.30, P<0.001) and caregiver burden (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.24-2.14, P<0.001). In addition, a higher Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia score was correlated with an improvement in the NPI behavior domain (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.01-2.18, P=0.047), whereas participants with hearing impairment had a lower chance of improvement in the NPI behavior domain (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01-1.23, P=0.073) and care burden (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.03-0.99, P=0.050).

"Availability of a safe and reliable water supply is an issue in developing nations, including India. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is a site-specific source control used to satisfy human, agricultural, and safety demands for water. This study analyzed the effects of capturing rainwater for a 12.5 year period (Jan 1999-Jun 2011) to provide three ecosystem services: water supplementation for indoor use, water supplementation for food production and groundwater recharge (GWR). A hydrologic analysis was completed using satellite rainfall data and a water balance approach. Two demand scenarios, indoor and outdoor, were considered, with water in excess of demand and storage directed to recharge groundwater. An economic analysis quantified RWH system net present value. The results indicated significant ecosystem services benefits were possible from RWH in India. RWH for the purpose of providing irrigation to a small garden and allowing overflow to a drywell for GWR was concluded to be an approach to maximize benefits. This scenario provided the greatest net present value (21,764-38,851 INR), fastest payback period (0.30-0.98 years), and recharge to groundwater of more than 40% of onsite rainfall. The benefit of the outdoor vegetable irrigation was determined and the results showed that the caloric demands of the typical Indian household (2.75kg of tomatoes and 1.05kg of lettuce) could be met with a 20m(2) garden, and excess food could be sold to offset the capital cost of the system and later for economic gain.

"Aim: The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of aging on the viscoelastic properties of the upper trapezius (UT) and the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle during transition from lying to sitting position. Materials and methods: The study included 39 older (mean age 67 +/- 5.9 years) and 36 younger (21.1 +/- 1.8 years) women. Tone, stiffness and elasticity of the UT and the SCM were measured by means of myotonometry (MyotonPRO) in lying and then, in sitting position. The results were compared using twoway analysis of variance. Results: Irrespective of the position, older women presented with significantly higher muscle tone, stiffness and elasticity than younger subjects (P < 0.05). In both groups, the transition from lying to sitting position resulted in a decrease (P0.05) of the SCM, and stimulated an increase in the tone, stiffness and elasticity of the UT (P < 0.05). The degree of changes in both study groups was similar, except from the absolute value of the UT elasticity, significantly higher increase in older women than in younger subjects (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Age contributes to an increase in the stiffness and tone of the UT and the SCM, as well as to a decrease in the elasticity of these muscles in female subjects. In contrast, age exerts only a slight effect on the mechanical properties of both muscles during transition from lying to sitting position. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The major advantage of perovskite-based devices is their relatively facile fabrication as a thin film at fairly low temperatures and their tunable optoelectronic properties. The chemical composition of perovskite structures, solvent and heat treatments used in processing, additives, and deposition methods produce films with different morphologies. Their ability to be used with other organic and inorganic subcells makes them a useful component for an efficient, cost-effective approach to harvest solar energy. This review presents some of the latest approaches and considerations for the fabrication, architecture, and performance of perovskite-based solar cells. Various perovskite device architectures are discussed, as well as the effects of environmental conditions on performance and degradation.

"Aims and objectives To explore sleep quality in infertile women and examine the factors that contribute to sleep disturbances during intrauterine insemination treatment. Background Sleep disturbance is an important factor of human health and well-being. Sleep disturbances tend to occur among infertile women during intrauterine insemination treatment. Although many studies have focused on the high percentage of somatic symptoms and psychological distress in infertile women associated with their treatment, few studies have investigated factors linked to their sleep disturbances. Design A cross-sectional study. Methods The study was conducted during the period of September 2010-January 2011 in a teaching hospital in Taiwan. Infertile women (n=117) who received assisted reproduction with intrauterine insemination treatment completed a questionnaire. Demographic data, somatic symptoms, psychological distress and perceived sleep quality were collected. Results More than one-third (35%) of the infertile women reported having sleep disturbances. Their nausea symptoms and psychological distress were risk factors that contributed to sleep disturbance. Conclusions The variables of nausea and psychological distress significantly explained 30% of the sleep disturbances in the infertile women. The evaluation of nausea symptoms and/or psychological distress among infertile women is an important area of future research; such research should aim to identify the best compromise between infertility treatment and sleep quality. Relevance to clinical practice Clinical obstetrics and gynaecology nurses should develop strategies to help infertile women reduce their nausea symptoms and psychological distress during intrauterine insemination treatment to promote healthy sleep.

"A very high gain (137 dB) two stage CMOS operational amplifier having structural simplicity of classical Widlar architecture has been presented. The differential input stage of proposed operational amplifier has been modified by incorporating inverse aspect ratio self cascode structures biased to operate in subthreshold region, to minimize the classical compensation capacitor to 0.1 pF and results in considerable saving in occupied chip area. P-SPICE simulations in 0.25 mu m CMOS technology at +/- 1 V supply have been carried out to compare the performance of proposed operational amplifier with previously reported designs. The proposed operational amplifier demonstrated better gain-bandwidth product of 1.37 MHz, low power consumption of 21 mu W and occupied smaller chip area of < 400 (mu m)(2).

"Aims and objectives. Our study was conducted to further investigate the model of social support and care for People Living with HIV/AIDS(PLHA), to explore their role in People Living with AIDS's quality of life (QOL) as reference for improving nursing policies for AIDS. Background. Social support and care are the most important factors impacting the QOL of People Living with HIV/AIDS, but most studies conducted upon the influence of social support and QOL of People Living with HIV/AIDS are mainly based on cross-sectional design. Design. Our study was a nonrandomised controlled community intervention study. Methods. The participants diagnosed as People Living with HIV/AIDS at Beijing You An Hospital received a comprehensive social support care from December 2013 to December 2014. To evaluate the impact of social support and care model on People Living with HIV/AIDS, our study analysed the different dimension scores of social support scale and quality of life before and after the intervention. Correlation between the net benefit value of social support and that of QOL from various dimensions were analysed. Results. There were significant differences in the score of objective support and usage of support (all p = 0.02) for social support. Net values of objective support score and usage of support were 0.25 and 0.19, respectively, after intervention. There were significant differences in physiological function, role physical, general health, vitality, social function, mental health, health transition and total score of quality of life (all p < 0.05). The canonical correlation analysis of net values of social support and QOL indicated that the first and second canonical correlation were statistically significant, with correlation coefficients of 0.53 (p = 0.00) and 0.21 (p = 0.04).

"As computer systems become more complicated, monitoring dataflows in a system becomes important for maintaining its performance. However, because conventional methods of dataflow monitoring are either too fine-grained or too coarse-grained, it is difficult to analyze application-specific performance metrics. In this paper, we propose a dataflow logger with suitable granularity for performance analysis. Our logger is implemented as a Java library, which tracks two types of dataflows: dataflows between objects inside a Java program, and dataflows between a Java object and a row and column in a relational database. That way, our logger can produce dataflow logs with rich semantics about the application's data model. We conduct an experiment with an example system and demonstrate that we can obtain dataflow logs useful for performance analysis. We also conduct detailed overhead analysis of our logger. Although our logger slows down the example system 13 times, we figure out major sources of the overhead. We argue possible solutions to the overhead.

"As a means to share knowledge, the community question answering (CQA) service provides users a chance to obtain or provide help by raising or answering questions. After a question is posted, the system must find an appropriate individual to answer this question. Several approaches have recently been proposed to find experts in CQA. In this paper, a new method to find experts in CQA is proposed by considering user post contents, answer votes, ratio of best answers, and user relation. The votes are used in post relation analysis to calculate user authority. The user's knowledge score can be calculated through topic analysis. Considering that a question usually includes many trivial words, an accurate distribution is nearly impossible to obtain with LDA. To solve this problem, vocabulary is extended by including the link information shown in a question; the top 10 relevant words from Wikipedia are provided for each tag. Tag-LDA models the user topic distribution and predicts the topic distribution of new questions. An experiment is conducted on Stack Overflow dataset, which is the world's largest computer programming CQA site. Experimental results showed approximately 2.97% to 7.79% performance improvement in nDCG@N metrics.

"Achieving sustainable energy systems involves complex decision-making processes. This article addresses the combination of life-cycle (LC) approaches and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for the sustainability assessment of energy systems. Through a literature survey of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) tools for sustainability assessment of energy systems, the most commonly used criteria, data sources and tools are identified. Moreover, a review of the LC + DEA approaches available to date is performed in order to check their convenience to assess energy systems in terms of sustainability. In this sense, the central focus of the article is to explore and elucidate potentials of these combined approaches within sustainability-oriented MCDA in the field of energy. These potentials are mainly associated with the usefulness of sustainability benchmarks for decision-makers and the wide availability of DEA models and life-cycle approaches. Given the growing role of MCDA tools in energy scenario analysis and the innovative trends found in LC + DEA, a novel methodological framework is proposed: enriched energy systems modelling through (i) endogenous integration of life-cycle indicators and (ii) ranking and benchmarking of energy scenarios according to sustainability criteria using dynamic DEA. The LC + DEA concept emerges as a promising methodology to evaluate and rank prospective scenarios in energy planning, thus facilitating decision-making processes towards a sustainable energy future.

"As is well known, activity level measurement and fusion rule are two crucial factors in image fusion. For most existing fusion methods, either in spatial domain or in a transform domain like wavelet, the activity level measurement is essentially implemented by designing local filters to extract high-frequency details, and the calculated clarity information of different source images are then compared using some elaborately designed rules to obtain a clarity/focus map. Consequently, the focus map contains the integrated clarity information, which is of great significance to various image fusion issues, such as multi-focus image fusion, multi-rhodal image fusion, etc. However, in order to achieve a satisfactory fusion performance, these two tasks are usually difficult to finish. In this study, we address this problem with a deep learning approach, aiming to learn a direct mapping between source images and focus map. To this end, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained by high-quality image patches and their blurred versions is adopted to encode the mapping. The main novelty of this idea is that the activity level measurement and fusion rule can be jointly generated through learning a CNN model, which overcomes the difficulty faced by the existing fusion methods. Based on the above idea, a new multi-focus image fusion method is primarily proposed in this paper. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain state-of-the-art fusion performance in terms of both visual quality and objective assessment. The computational speed of the proposed method using parallel computing is fast enough for practical usage. The potential of the learned CNN model for some other-type image fusion issues is also briefly exhibited in the experiments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Aim: Children have the highest rates of food-related allergic reactions. While 85% of children outgrow allergies including cow's milk and eggs by five years of age, allergies to peanuts and seafood continue into adulthood. The school setting poses a high-risk environment for allergen exposure. The aim of the present study was to examine the availability, drivers and communication of school food allergy awareness and management policies/guidelines in one Australian education jurisdiction. Methods: A cross-sectional study comprising an online survey of principals on school allergy awareness (n = 100) was conducted in public, catholic and independent primary and high schools in an Australian education jurisdiction between August 2011 and November 2012. Results: Sixty-three per cent (17/27) of schools responding to the survey reported using food allergy management guidelines. An average of 13 students per school were reported to have a food allergy with 93% of schools reported having students with at least one food allergy. Parents, not government policy, were identified as primary drivers of food allergy guideline implementation and a third of schools provided anaphylaxis training annually. Communication of food allergy management was limited with only 42 school websites either providing access to policies/guidelines or providing a food allergy statement. Conclusions: Detailed awareness and management guidelines are integral for schools to adequately manage food-induced allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in the school environment. To enable this, national government support through legislation and policy is needed to ensure a consistent, up-to-date and policed approach to food allergy management in the Australian education sector.

"Aim: To compare the differences in contraceptive characteristics and the knowledge of emergency contraception (ECP) among women who used ECP after unprotected intercourse and those who sought an abortion. Methods: A questionnaire survey was conducted in a Hungarian university hospital among women for whom ECP was prescribed after unprotected intercourse (n=940) as well as women who presented for the termination of pregnancy (n=1592) between January 1, 2005 and November 20, 2006. Their knowledge of ECP and their experience with and attitudes toward ECP use were targeted. Results: The availability of ECP was well known (87.9%), but it was still greatly underutilized: applied by only 13 of the 1592 women who resorted to abortion. Primarily, the ECP group consisted of those who experienced a condom failure significantly more often (odds ratio [OR]=4.1), followed by those cases where ECP applications was a consequence of not using any kind of contraception (OR=3.8). Fewer than one third (32%) of the abortion seekers had previously used ECP, and only one fifth knew how to obtain it. Appropriate awareness of ECP was influenced by information obtained from health-care providers (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=3.93) or school education (AOR=1.82). Conclusions: More thorough education is needed to provide a deeper knowledge of ECP use during contraceptive counseling for women seeking abortion, including those contraceptive mishaps where unintended pregnancy can be prevented by ECP.

"Aim. - Adiponectin is the most abundant adipokine and may play a key role in the interplay between obesity, inflammation, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Thus, this large population-based cohort investigated whether adiponectin at baseline and/or a decrease in adiponectin during follow-up is associated prospectively with the risk of incident MetS. Methods. - Using a prospective study design, the development of MetS was examined in 1134 healthy participants from the community. Plasma adiponectin was measured at study entry and again after a median follow-up of 9.4 years (IQR: 9.2-9.7). During follow-up, 187 participants developed MetS, and 439 presented with at least two components of MetS. Results. - During follow-up, adiponectin decreased in participants who developed MetS, whereas adiponectin was increased in those who did not develop MetS (P < 0.001). Those with low adiponectin levels (quartile 1) at baseline had an increased risk of developing MetS (OR: 2.92, 2.08-6.97; P < 0.001) compared with those with high levels (quartile 4). After adjusting for confounding variables, low adiponectin levels at baseline remained independently associated with MetS (OR: 2.24, 1.11-4.52; P = 0.017). Similarly, participants with a decrease in adiponectin during follow-up also had an increased risk of MetS (OR: 2.96, 2.09-4.18; P < 0.001). This association persisted after multivariable adjustments, including for baseline adiponectin (OR: 4.37, 2.77-6.97; P < 0.001). Finally, adiponectin levels at follow-up were inversely associated with an increase in the number of components of MetS (P <0.001); geometric mean adiponectin levels were 9.5 mg/L (95% CI: 9.0-10.0) for participants with no components vs 7.0 mg/L (95% CI: 6.3-7.9) for those with four to five components. Conclusions/interpretation. - Low plasma adiponectin levels at baseline and decreasing adiponectin levels during follow-up are both associated with an increased risk of MetS.

Design of experiments is employed to determine factors controlling the value of parameters and the target levels of those values to achieve desirable output. The efficiency of the modified COA algorithm is substantiated with the help of several optimization test problems. The results are then compared to other well-known algorithms such as PSO, DE and harmony search using a non-parametric statistical procedure. In order to analyze its effectiveness, the proposed modified COA is applied to a feature selection problem and spacecraft attitude control problem.

"A type of norm-adaption penalized least mean square/fourth (NA-LMS/F) algorithm is proposed for sparse channel estimation applications. The proposed NA-LMS/F algorithm is realized by incorporating a p-norm-like into the cost function of the conventional least mean square/fourth (LMS/F) which acts as a combination of the l(0)- and l(1)-norm constraints. A reweighted NA-LMS/F (RNA-LMS/F) algorithm is also developed by adding a reweighted factor in the NA-LMS/F algorithm. The proposed RNA-LMS/F algorithm exhibits an improved performance in terms of the convergence speed and the steady-state error, which can provide a zero attractor to further exploit the sparsity of the channel by the use of the-norm adaption penalty and the reweighting factor. The simulation results obtained from the sparse channel estimations are given to verify that our proposed RNA-LMS/F algorithm is superior to the previously reported sparse aware LMS/F and the conventional LMS/F algorithms in terms of both the convergence speed and the steady-state behavior.

"Aims and objectives. To describe nursing activities in primary care with patients affected by physical chronic disease and common mental disorders. Background. Patients in primary care who are affected by physical chronic disease and common mental disorders such as anxiety and depression require care and follow-up based on their physical and mental health condition. Primary care nurses are increasingly expected to contribute to the care and follow-up of this growing clientele. However, little is known about the actual activities carried out by primary care nurses in providing this service in the Province of Quebec (Canada). Methods. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted. Data were obtained through semistructured individual interviews with 13 nurses practising among patients with physical chronic disease in seven Family Medicine Groups in Quebec (Canada). Results. Participants described five activity domains: assessment of physical and mental health condition, care planning, interprofessional collaboration, therapeutic relationship and health promotion. Conclusion. The full potential of primary care nurses is not always exploited, and some activities could be improved. Evidence for including nurses in collaborative care for patients affected by physical chronic disease and common mental disorders has been shown but is not fully implemented in Family Medicine Groups. Future research should emphasise collaboration among mental health professionals, primary care nurses and family physicians in the care of patients with physical chronic disease and common mental disorders. Relevance to clinical practice. Primary care nurses would benefit from gaining more knowledge about common mental disorders and from identifying the resources they need to contribute to managing them in an interdisciplinary team.

"Aim: The aim of this study was to quantify the prevalence of somatic pain in a paediatric emergency department (ED). Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study using patients admitted to the ED of an Italian children's hospital between December 2014 and February 2015. We enrolled children aged 7-17 who turned up at the ED complaining of pain. Patients and parents were asked to fill in a questionnaire to allow the analysis of the patients' medical history and provide contact details for follow-up. We divided the enrolled patients into four groups: post-traumatic pain, organic pain, functional pain and somatic pain. The questionnaire was used to define pain characteristics and to generate an impairment score. Results: Of the 713 patients who met inclusion criteria, 306 (42.9%) were enrolled in the study. Of these, 135 (44.0%) suffered from post-traumatic pain, 104 (34.0%) from organic pain, 41 (13.4%) from functional pain and 26 (8.6%) from somatic pain. Somatic pain patients had endured pain longer, had missed more school days and had suffered severe functional impairment. Conclusion: This study highlighted that somatic pain was a significant contributor to paediatric emergency room visits and should be suspected and diagnosed in children reporting pain.

"As the sustainability of building projects has become of great concern for construction professionals, a number of different green building rating systems have been developed to help ensure that building projects are designed and built using strategies intended to minimize or eliminate their impacts on the environment. In the United States, although the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building rating system has been widely accepted as the national standard for sustainable building design, its assessment of green buildings is challenging and time-consuming owing to its complicated process. Such a green building rating process could be accelerated and facilitated by using computer technology such as building information modeling (BIM), an innovative, new approach to building design, engineering, and construction management that has been widely used in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. To enable the green building rating for a building design in BIM applications, building information must be represented in such a way that the knowledge contained in LEED green building criteria can be extracted from the BIM model to support the assessment. In this paper, a building knowledge framework representing the LEED green building criteria will be presented. The proposed framework was implemented into a BIM platform to obtain an automated tool for the rating of a green building design. The development of the automated green building rating system and the results of its implementation will be discussed. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

"Aim: The study aimed to explore the association between maternal communication style [controlling vs. autonomy-supportive (AS)] and adolescents' motivation to change alcohol use, as well as the intervening role of autonomy and relatedness needs frustration and coping responses (i.e. oppositional defiance and submission) in this association. Methods: A vignette-based study was conducted with 134 adolescents (M-age = 17.46 years) randomly assigned to a controlling or an AS condition, describing a maternal reaction to an alcohol use episode. Then, adolescents reported upon their experienced need frustration, their coping responses and their motivation to change alcohol use. Findings: Results indicated that adolescents in the controlling condition felt more frustrated in their needs for autonomy and relatedness that adolescents confronted with the AS reaction. When adolescents experienced frustration regarding their autonomy need, they coped by submitting to the maternal request, which in turn predicted greater motivation to change alcohol use. However, when they experienced frustration regarding their relatedness need, they engaged in oppositional defiance to the request, which in turn predicted lower motivation to change alcohol use. Conclusions: These results suggest that controlling maternal communication style relates to two distinct processes that have opposing effects on adolescents' motivation to change alcohol use.

"Because of a lack of existing studies of fatigue testing of interlaminar anticracking materials, this study analyzes the principle of generating reflective cracks using three types of composite specimens: a direct overlay asphalt mixture layer, a repaving - impregnated nonwoven geotextile layer, and a repaving anticracking material layer. The study proposes a method for laboratory fatigue testing and observing reflective cracks. The specimens were used in a bending fatigue test with a centric load and a shear fatigue test with an eccentric load. The test results were analyzed by regression analyses that showed that the anticracking material layer had much better crack resistance than the direct overlay asphalt mixture layer and the repaving - impregnated nonwoven geotextiles layer, because the anticracking material layer could absorb most of bending and shear stresses near the cracks to efficiently delay the generation and expansion of reflective cracks. This study can be used as a reference to make a reasonable selection of an interlaminar anticracking material for rigid - flexible composite pavements. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Event-free survival at 90 days was similar between controls and elderly patients [odds ratio (OR), 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.3-2.5; P>0.05]. There was a trend toward greater hospitalization (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 0.52-5.95; P= 0.546) and mortality (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 0.3-14.01; P= 0.182). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest event-free survival is similar between nonelderly and elderly patients. Although statistically significant, there is a tendency toward greater mortality and hospitalization in the elderly.

"Based on fuzzy decision theory, multi objective fuzzy optimization is done for three dynamic model scheme of self-anchored cable-stayed suspension bridge. Combining the fuzzy decision method with engineering practice and using two comparison theory solves the problem of quantifying the qualitative indexes. Comparison results show that it is more reasonable to place viscous dampers between main tower and girder, with longitudinal displacement on mid-span of girder on the same time. This method can provide a reference for structure selection in practical conceptual design phase.

"A unique course named ""Introduction to Engineering Design"" has been recently developed and implemented at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. The course allows top 12th grade students who are majoring in science and engineering to experience engineering design. At the end of the course, the students plan and implement-on a team basis-a real-time control system for an electric motor. The course is intended to increase its graduates' motivation in science and engineering, develop their systems thinking skills and train them in teamwork, as such skills will assist them in their future engineering work. The study described in this paper examined-through quantitative and qualitative tools-to what degree the course's first two objectives had been attained. Thirty-two students participated in the study and its findings indicate an improvement in the students' intrinsic motivation to study science and engineering (medium effect size) and in their systems thinking skills (large effect size).

"Based on taking full account of the building load and renewable energy output characteristics in cold regions, a multi-source hybrid heat pump system (MSHHPS) with seasonal thermal storage was proposed. The seasonal thermal storage comprehensively utilized solar energy, geothermal energy and air energy. The composition and operation modes of the system were introduced. The mathematical model of the main parts of the proposed system was established. The transition condition of the different operating modes of the system was determined. Taking a building in Harbin as the object for simulation analysis, the operation effect and the change of the soil temperature field of the system were obtained. The results showed that: The average coefficient of performance (COP) of the MSHHPS with seasonal thermal storage was 3.06 (in the Harbin region for 10 years), the soil thermal balance rate was 100.33% and the energy-saving rate was 29.84% comparing to the ground source heat pump system (GSHPS). For the initial investment, MSHHPS only required additional double-source heat pump unit, which accounted at 9.59%. The static payback period of the double-source heat pump unit was 4 years. The system can maintain efficient and economical operation in the typical cold regions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Aim: The augmentation of late sodium current (I-Na.L) not only causes intracellular Na+ accumulation, which results in intracellular Ca2+ overload via the reverse mode of the Na+/Ca2+ exchange current (reverse-I-NCX), but also prolongs APD and induces early afterdepolarizations (EAD), which can lead to arrhythmia and cardiac dysfunction. Thus, the inhibition of I-Na.L is considered to be a potential way for therapeutic intervention in ischemia and heart failure. In this study we investigated the effects of tolterodine (Tol), a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist, on normal and veratridine (Ver)-augmented I-Na.L, reverse-I-NCX and APD in isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes, which might contribute to its cardioprotective activity. Methods: Rabbit ventricular myocytes were prepared. The I-Na.L and reverse-I-NCX were recorded in voltage clamp mode, whereas action potentials and Ver-induced early afterdepolarizations (EADs) were recorded in current clamp mode. Drugs were applied via superfusion. Results: Tol (3-120 nmol/L) concentration-dependently inhibited the normal and Ver-augmented I-Na.L with IC50 values of 32.08 nmol/L and 42.47 nmol/L, respectively. Atropine (100 mu mol/L) did not affect the inhibitory effects of Tol (30 nmol/L) on Ver-augmented I-Na.L. In contrast, much high concentrations of Tol was needed to inhibit the transient sodium current (I-Na.T) with an IC50 value of 183.03 mu mol/L. In addition, Tol (30 nmol/L) significantly shifted the inactivation curve of I-Na.T toward a more depolarizing membrane potential without affecting its activation characteristics. Moreover, Tol (30 nmol/L) significantly decreased Ver-augmented reverse-I-NCX. Tol (30 nmol/L) increased the action potential duration (APD) by 16% under the basal conditions. Ver (20 mu mol/L) considerably extended the APD and evoked EADs in 18/24 cells (75%). In the presence of Ver, Tol (30 nmol/L) markedly decreased the APD and eliminated EADs (0/24 cells). Conclusion: Tol inhibits normal and Ver-augmented I-NaL and decreases Ver-augmented reverse-I-NCX. In addition, Tol reverses the prolongation of the APD and eliminates the EADs induced by Ver, thus prevents Ver-induced arrhythmia.

"AIM To observe whether there are differences in the effects of electro-acupuncture (EA) and moxibustion (Mox) in rats with visceral hypersensitivity. METHODS EA at 1 mA and 3 mA and Mox at 43 degrees C and 46 degrees C were applied to the Shangjuxu (ST37, bilateral) acupoints in model rats with visceral hypersensitivity. Responses of wide dynamic range neurons in dorsal horns of the spinal cord were observed through the extracellular recordings. Mast cells (MC) activity in the colons of rats were assessed, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor (5-HT3R) and 5-HT4R expressions in the colons were measured. RESULTS Compared with normal control group, responses of wide dynamic range neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord were increased in the EA at 1 mA and 3 mA groups (1 mA: 0.84 +/- 0.74 vs 2.73 +/- 0.65, P < 0.001; 3 mA: 1.91 +/- 1.48 vs 6.44 +/- 1.26, P < 0.001) and Mox at 43 degrees C and 46 degrees C groups (43 degrees C: 1.76 +/- 0.81 vs 4.14 +/- 1.83, P = 0.001; 46 degrees C: 5.19 +/- 2.03 vs 7.91 +/- 2.27, P = 0.01). MC degranulation rates and the expression of 5-HT, 5-HT3R and 5-HT4R in the colon of Mox 46 degrees C group were decreased compared with model group (MC degranulation rates: 0.47 +/- 0.56 vs 0.28 +/- 0.78, P < 0.001; 5-HT: 1.42 +/- 0.65 vs 7.38 +/- 1.12, P < 0.001; 5-HT3R: 6.62 +/- 0.77 vs 2.86 +/- 0.88, P < 0.001; 5-HT4R: 4.62 +/- 0.65 vs 2.22 +/- 0.97, P < 0.001).

"As a commercial distributed computing mode, cloud computing needs to meet the quality of service (QoS) requirement of users, which is its top priority. However, cloud computing service providers also need to consider how to reduce the overhead of data center, and keep load balancing is one of the key points to maximize the use of the resource in the data center. In this paper, we propose an improved multi-objective niched Pareto genetic algorithm (NPGA) to take load balancing into consideration without affecting performance of time consumption and financial cost of handling the user's cloud computing tasks by presenting the load balancing shift mutation operator. The simulation results and analysis show that the proposed algorithm performs better than NPGA in maintaining the diversity and the distribution of the Pareto-optimal solutions in the cloud tasks scheduling under the same population size and evolution generation.

"As VLSI technology advances towards nanoscale devices, interconnect delay is becoming increasingly important, and could be effectively reduced using buffer insertion. The widely-used buffer insertion technique in industry is to insert a set of buffers on the chip, which may overlap some gates, and then greedily move the buffers to the nearest available buffer holes. The moving distance of inserted buffers largely affects the wirelength which may result in the increase of the interconnect delay. This necessitates efficient algorithms to minimize the moving distance of buffers for effective buffer insertion to obtain high-performance VLSI designs. This paper proposes an efficient, perturbation constrained buffer planning algorithm to maximize the candidate buffer holes with regarding to the feature of CPS based buffering design framework. Instead of directly moving buffers to the existing available buffer holes, the proposed algorithm changes the original placement by moving some gates tinily to provide more flexibility for buffer insertion. The integer linear programming based technique is designed for the physical design flow which allows small moving range of gates. Parallel technique is utilized to solve the ILP problems efficiently when the scale of chip is increasing. Experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm achieves at most 41.49% increase in the available buffer holes when compared to the algorithm with no gate movement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Background: Despite claims that the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) targets on access to safe drinking water have been met, many 100 s of millions of people still have no access. The challenge remains how to provide these people and especially young children with safe drinking water. Method: We report a longitudinal study designed to assess the effectiveness of an intervention based on provided treated drinking water in containers on self-reported diarrhoea in children. The intervention was ""1001 fontaines pour demain"" (1001 F) is a non-governmental not for profit organization (created in 2004 and based in Caluire, France) that helps local entrepreneurs treat package, and sell safe drinking water. Cases and controls were chosen at village and household level by propensity score matching Participants were visited twice a month over six months and asked to complete a diarrhoea health diary. Results: In total 4275 follow-up visits were completed on 376 participants from 309 homes. Diarrhoea was reported in 20.4% of children on each visit, equating to an incidence rate estimate of 5.32 episodes per child per year (95% confidence interval = 4.97 to 5.69). Compared to those drinking 1001 F water, children drinking surface water were 33% (95% CI -1 to 17%), those drinking protected ground water were 62% (95% CI 19 to 120%) and those drinking other bottled water 57% (95% CI 15 to 114%) more likely to report diarrhoea. Children drinking harvested rainwater had similar rates of diarrhoea to Children drinking 1001 F water. Conclusion: Our study suggests that 1001 F water provides a safer alternative to groundwater or surface water. Furthermore, our study raises serious concerns about the validity of assuming protected groundwater to be safe water for the purposes of assessing the MDG targets. By contrast our study provides addition evidence of the relative safety of rainwater harvesting.

"Aim: Patients with gynecologic cancer frequently experience bone loss due to cancer treatments, including bilateral oophorectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This study evaluated treatment-associated changes in bone mineral density (BMD) in women with gynecologic cancer and compared changes among patients with different types of gynecologic cancer. Methods: BMD of the lumbar spine and femur was retrospectively analyzed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 118 women who underwent treatment for gynecological cancers and 132 women without gynecologic cancers. The cohort included 55 women with cervical cancer who underwent surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, 33 with endometrial cancer (EC) who underwent surgery followed by adjuvant radiation therapy and 30 with ovarian cancer who underwent bilateral oophorectomy followed by adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. Lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD were assessed at baseline and 12 months after treatment. Areal BMD, expressed as grams of mineral/cm2 scanned, was compared with that in young healthy women (T-score). Results: Demographic characteristics and pretreatment BMDs, including T-scores, did not differ among cancer types. After adjustment for factors that can affect T-score, cancer type affected change in T-score 12 months after treatment. After adjustment for pretreatment age, parity, BMI and T-score, T-score 12 months after treatment was significantly lower in the EC than in the other groups. Conclusions: Women treated for gynecological cancer, particularly those with EC who undergo bilateral oophorectomy followed by adjuvant radiation therapy or chemotherapy, should be managed in a timely manner to prevent or minimize bone loss.

"As a novel learning algorithm for a single hidden-layer feedforward neural network, the extreme learning machine has attracted much research attention for its fast training speed and good generalization performances. Instead of iteratively tuning the parameters, the extreme machine can be seen as a linear optimization problem by randomly generating the input weights and hidden biases. However, the random determination of the input weights and hidden biases may bring non-optimal parameters, which have a negative impact on the final results or need more hidden nodes for the neural network. To overcome the above drawbacks caused by the non-optimal input weights and hidden biases, we propose a new hybrid learning algorithm named dolphin swarm algorithm extreme learning machine adopting the dolphin swarm algorithm to optimize the input weights and hidden biases efficiently. Each set of input weights and hidden biases is encoded into one vector, namely the dolphin. The dolphins are evaluated by root mean squared error and updated by the four pivotal phases of the dolphin swarm algorithm. Eventually, we will obtain an optimal set of input weights and hidden biases. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we compare the proposed algorithm with the standard extreme learning machine and three state-of-the-art methods, which are the particle swarm optimization extreme learning machine, evolutionary extreme learning machine, and self-adaptive evolutionary extreme learning machine, under 13 benchmark datasets obtained from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior generalization performances than all the compared algorithms.

However, the relative effects of dementia on these factors are unknown. We investigated variability in behavioral independence and disturbance profiles of patients with dementia. MethodsThis was a cross-sectional correlation study in which 70 inpatients with dementia from convalescent wards in a hospital were enrolled. We assessed cognitive impairments with the Mini-Mental State Examination, evaluated behavioral independence levels with the Functional Independence Measure and assessed frequency of behavioral disturbances with the Dementia Behavior Disturbance Scale. ResultsCoefficient determination was 0.395 (P<0.0001) between the Mini-Mental State Examination and Functional Independence Measure scores, 0.261 (P<0.0001) between the Mini-Mental State Examination and Dementia Behavior Disturbance Scale scores, and 0.355 (P<0.0001) between the Functional Independence Measure and Dementia Behavior Disturbance Scale scores. The most easily accomplished behavioral independence was eating, and the hardest was transfer to tub/shower. The behavioral disturbance with the highest frequency was urinary incontinence, and the lowest was emptying drawers or closets. ConclusionsModerate correlations were found between severity of dementia and behavioral independence levels and frequencies of behavioral disturbances. There were both easier and harder to accomplish behaviors, and both higher and lower frequencies of behavioral disturbances. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2017; 17: 605-613.

"As the popularity of software-defined networks (SDN) and OpenFlow increases, policy-driven network management has received more attention. Manual configuration of multiple devices is being replaced by an automated approach where a software-based, network-aware controller handles the configuration of all network devices. Software applications running on top of the network controller provide an abstraction of the topology and facilitate the task of operating the network. We propose OpenSec, an OpenFlow-based security framework that allows a network security operator to create and implement security policies written in human-readable language. Using OpenSec, the user can describe a flow in terms of OpenFlow matching fields, define which security services must be applied to that flow (deep packet inspection, intrusion detection, spam detection, etc.) and specify security levels that define how OpenSec reacts if malicious traffic is detected. In this paper, we first provide a more detailed explanation of how OpenSec converts security policies into a series of OpenFlow messages needed to implement such a policy. Second, we describe how the framework automatically reacts to security alerts as specified by the policies. Third, we perform additional experiments on the GENI testbed to evaluate the scalability of the proposed framework using existing datasets of campus networks. Our results show that up to 95% of attacks in an existing data set can be detected and 99% of malicious source nodes can be blocked automatically. Furthermore, we show that our policy specification language is simpler while offering fast translation times compared to existing solutions.

Methods: We collected questionnaire data on asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC) and eczema in children aged seven to eight years from Molndal, Gothenburg, in south-western Sweden and Kiruna in northern Sweden in 1979 (n = 4682), 1991 (n = 2481) and 2007 (n = 1029). The same regions and questions were used in all three studies, and extra questions on food allergy or intolerance were added in 2007. Results: In 1979, 1991 and 2007, the total prevalence of asthma was 2.5%, 5.7% and 7.1%, ARC was 5.5%, 8.1% and 11.1% and eczema was 7.1%, 18.3% and 19.7%, respectively. Asthma prevalence remained higher in Kiruna, but no significant regional differences were seen for ARC and eczema. Almost 20% reported a history of food allergy or intolerance, with a higher prevalence in Kiruna. The allergy risk was reduced if both parents were born outside Sweden. Conclusion: The prevalence of ARC continued to increase between 1991 and 2007, but increases in asthma and eczema started to level off in 1991.

"Based on the same toxic level of 0.6% LC50 for 96-h and the severe situation of water pollution, we compared effects of chronic Zn (180 mu g L-1) and Cd exposures (30 mu g L-1) on growth, survival, histology, ultrastructure, and oxidative stress in the liver of zebrafish for 5 weeks. Growth performance and survival rate remained relatively constant under Zn stress, but was reduced under Cd exposure. Cd exposure also induced severe pyknotic nuclei, evident ultrastructure damage, and considerable lipid inclusions in the hepatocytes. However, these phenomena were not pronounced under Zn exposure. The negative effects caused by Cd may be explained by an increase in hepatic oxidative damage, as reflected by the enhanced levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein carbonylation (PC). The reduced activity of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) and catalase (CAT) may result in the enhanced hepatic oxidative damage, though the mRNA and protein levels of both genes increased and remained unchanged respectively. On the contrary, Zn up-regulated the levels of mRNA, protein and activity of Cu/Zn-SOD, which may contribute to the decreased LPO levels. Nonetheless, the sharply up-regulated mRNA levels of CAT did not induce an increase in the protein and activity levels of CAT under Zn stress. Furthermore, transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression parelleled with its target genes, suggesting that Nrf2 is required for the protracted induction of antioxidant genes. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that essential and non-essential metals induced some differences in oxidative damage in fish. The differences were not caused by the transcriptional level of related genes but depended on post-transcriptional modifications. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

"As an important pre-processing stage in many machine learning and pattern recognition domains, feature selection deems to identify the most discriminate features for a compact data representation. As typical feature selection methods, Lasso and its variants using the l(1)-norm based regularization have received much attention in recent years. However, most of existing l(1)-norm based sparse feature selection methods ignore the structure information of data or only consider the pairwise relationships among samples. In this paper, we propose a hypergraph regularized sparse feature learning method, where the high-order relationships among samples are modeled and incorporated into the learning process. Specifically, we first construct a hypergraph with multiple hyperedges to capture the high-order relationships among samples, followed by the computation of a hypergraph Laplacian matrix. Then, we propose a hypergraph regularization term, and a hypergraph regularized Lasso model. We conduct a series of experiments on a number of data sets from UCI machine learning repository, and two real-world neuroimaging based classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves promising classification results, compared with several well known feature selection approaches.

"Assignment of 16S rRNA gene sequences to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) is a computational bottleneck in the process of analyzing microbial communities. Although this has been an active area of research, it has been difficult to overcome the time and memory demands while improving the quality of the OTU assignments. Here, we developed a new OTU assignment algorithm that iteratively reassigns sequences to new OTUs to optimize the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), a measure of the quality of OTU assignments. To assess the new algorithm, OptiClust, we compared it to 10 other algorithms using 16S rRNA gene sequences from two simulated and four natural communities. Using the OptiClust algorithm, the MCC values averaged 15.2 and 16.5% higher than the OTUs generated when we used the average neighbor and distance-based greedy clustering with VSEARCH, respectively. Furthermore, on average, OptiClust was 94.6 times faster than the average neighbor algorithm and just as fast as distance-based greedy clustering with VSEARCH. An empirical analysis of the efficiency of the algorithms showed that the time and memory required to perform the algorithm scaled quadratically with the number of unique sequences in the data set. The significant improvement in the quality of the OTU assignments over previously existing methods will significantly enhance downstream analysis by limiting the splitting of similar sequences into separate OTUs and merging of dissimilar sequences into the same OTU. The development of the OptiClust algorithm represents a significant advance that is likely to have numerous other applications. IMPORTANCE The analysis of microbial communities from diverse environments using 16S rRNA gene sequencing has expanded our knowledge of the biogeography of microorganisms. An important step in this analysis is the assignment of sequences into taxonomic groups based on their similarity to sequences in a database or based on their similarity to each other, irrespective of a database. In this study, we present a new algorithm for the latter approach. The algorithm, OptiClust, seeks to optimize a metric of assignment quality by shuffling sequences between taxonomic groups. We found that OptiClust produces more robust assignments and does so in a rapid and memory-efficient manner. This advance will allow for a more robust analysis of microbial communities and the factors that shape them.

Method: MEDLINE and PsychINFO search identified 986 studies published from 1990 to December 2016. Two independent researchers identified eligible studies. Study quality was assessed using Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). Results: The systematic search resulted in 1 to 14 longitudinal studies per parenting practice. Studies scored between 4 and 9 on the NOS, indicating an overall moderate quality. The results of complete smoking house rules showed a preventive effect on smoking onset. Furthermore, availability of cigarettes, frequency and quality of communication, parental reaction (i.e., conflict engagement) and norms showed significant and non-significant effects. Significant results were in line with expectations: availability of cigarettes and frequent.communication about smoking predicted smoking, whereas a high quality of communication, negative reactions or punishments and setting norms by parents showed a preventive effect. No effects were found for non-smoking agreements. The number of studies was too limited to draw conclusions about other parenting strategies. More research on (1) reliable and valid instruments, (2) other stages of smoking in addition to onset, and (3) potential moderators and mediators is warranted.

"Automatic registration of multimodal remote sensing data [e.g., optical, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)] is a challenging task due to the significant nonlinear radiometric differences between these data. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel feature descriptor named the histogram of orientated phase congruency (HOPC), which is based on the structural properties of images. Furthermore, a similarity metric named HOPCncc is defined, which uses the normalized correlation coefficient (NCC) of the HOPC descriptors for multimodal registration. In the definition of the proposed similarity metric, we first extend the phase congruency model to generate its orientation representation and use the extended model to build HOPCncc. Then, a fast template matching scheme for this metric is designed to detect the control points between images. The proposed HOPCncc aims to capture the structural similarity between images and has been tested with a variety of optical, LiDAR, SAR, and map data. The results show that HOPCncc is robust against complex nonlinear radiometric differences and outperforms the state-ofthe- art similarities metrics (i.e., NCC and mutual information) in matching performance. Moreover, a robust registration method is also proposed in this paper based on HOPCncc, which is evaluated using six pairs of multimodal remote sensing images. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for multimodal image registration.

"As one branch of stereo matching, video stereo matching becomes more and more significant in computer vision applications. The conventional stereo matching methods for static images would cause flicker-frames and worse matching results. We propose a joint motion-based square step (JMSS) method for stereo video matching.

"A theoretical analysis of the generation of electrical streaming currents and electrical power by two-phase flow in a rectangular capillary is presented. The injection of a second, non-conducting fluid phase tends to increase the internal electrical resistance of the electrical generator, thereby increasing the power output. If the viscosity of the injected fluid is large, the resulting high shear rate in the low-viscosity fluid at the wall generates a large streaming current and the power generated is further enhanced. However, if the injected fluid viscosity is low, the wall shear rate in the more viscous suspending fluid is reduced, as are streaming currents. Power generation would be small but for capillary effects at the ends of the bubbles that increase the pressure drop along the capillary above that expected for annular flow.

"As a result of the rapid growth in popularity of portable digital devices in recent years, the power requirements for computer operating systems used in these devices have also rapidly increased as both their complexity and processing power have increased. Compared with systems based on DRAM as main memory, PCM (Phase change memory), a new memory technology, can significantly reduce power consumption because data stored in PCM does not disappear when the device is powered down. This paper will first discuss several PCM-RAM-based hybrid systems. In these systems, the amount of read-only data influences the design of the hybrid structure. In the experiment section, it was found that almost 80% of data was semi-read-only.

"As a preprocessing step for computer vision tasks, research on generating superpixels of an image has been widely conducted recently. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic superpixel generation algorithm by simplifying the 3D triangle mesh modeled from a 2D input image. The simplification is performed based on a modified quadric error metric (QEM) method. The pipeline of our algorithm is simple. Given an image, we first turn it into a 2D triangle mesh and then lift the mesh to 3D based on the gray values of the image. We then simplify the 3D mesh based on the modified QEM method which encodes the features in the image intrinsically to ensure feature-aware superpixels. After obtaining the simplified mesh, we map it back to the 2D image to generate triangular-shaped superpixels. Our algorithm is fully automatic. The number of superpixels can be controlled intuitively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

"Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) belong to a class of Pro/Hyp-rich glycoproteins and are some of the most complex types of macromolecules found in plants. In the economically important plant species, Brassica rapa, only chimeric AGPs have been identified to date. This has significantly limited our understanding of the functional roles of AGPs in this plant. In this study, 64 AGPs were identified in the genome of B. rapa, including 33 classical AGPs, 28 AG peptides and three lys-rich AGPs. Syntenic gene analysis between B. rapa and A. thaliana suggested that the whole genome triplication event dominated the expansion of the AGP gene family in B. rapa. This resulted in a high retained proportion of the AGP family in the B. rapa genome, especially in the least fractionated subgenome. Phylogenetic and motif analysis classified the classical AGPs into six clades and three orphan genes, and the AG peptides into three clades and five orphan genes. Classical AGPs has a faster rate of molecular evolution than AG peptides revealed by estimation of molecular evolution rates. However, no significant differences were observed between classical AGPs and lys-rich AGPs. Under control conditions and in response to phytohormones treatment, a complete expression profiling experiment has identified five anther-specific AGPs and quite a number of AGPs responding to abscisic acid, methyl jasmonate and/or gibberellin. In this study, we presented a bioinformatics approach to identify important types of AGPs. Moreover, the association between their function and their protein structure, as well as the evolution and the expression of AGP genes were investigated, which might provide fundamental information for revealing the roles of AGPs in B. rapa.

"Autonomy and adaptability are key features of intelligent agents. Many applications of intelligent agents, such as the control of ambient intelligence environments and autonomous intelligent robotic systems, require the processing of information coming in from many available sensors to produce adequate output responses in changing scenarios. Autonomy, in these cases, applies not only to the ability of the agent to produce correct outputs without human guidance, but also to its ubiquity and/or portability, low-power consumption and integrability. In this sense, an embedded electronic system implementation paradigm can be applied to the design of autonomous intelligent agents in order to satisfy the above mentioned characteristics. However, processing complex computational intelligence algorithms with tight delay constraints in resource-constrained and low power embedded systems is a challenging engineering problem. In this paper a single-chip intelligent agent based on a computationally efficient neuro-fuzzy information processing core is described. The system has been endowed with an information preprocessing module based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that permits a substantial reduction of the input space dimensionality with little loss of modeling capability. Moreover, the PCA module has been tested as a means to achieve deep adaptability in changing environment dynamics and to endow the agent with fault tolerance in the presence of sensor failures. For data driven trials and research, a data set obtained from an experimental intelligent inhabited environment has been used as a benchmark system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Background: The rotator cable is an important structure providing stress shield to the rotator cuff, similar to the mechanism of suspension bridge. Purpose: To evaluate the visibility and appearance of the rotator cable in various conditions of the rotator cuff, using indirect magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography. Material and Methods: Indirect MR arthrography images from 27 patients (age range, 20-63 years) with normal rotator cuffs, and 47 (age range, 20-73 years) with tendinosis, 32 (age range, 49-71 years) with partial-thickness tears, and 55 (age range, 44-75 years) with full-thickness tears in the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons (SST-ISTs) were included in this study. In these various rotator cuff conditions, the visibility and appearance (thickness and width) of the rotator cable and the relationships between the rotator cable appearance, rotator cuff tear size, rotator cuff thickness, and patient's age were assessed. Results: On the sagittal MR images, all rotator cables were visible in the normal rotator cuffs and tendinosis/partial-thickness tears of SST-ISTs. In the order of normal cuff, tendinosis, partial-thickness tear, and full-thickness tear of SST-ISTs, the rotator cable tended to become thicker (1.07, 1.27, 1.32, and 1.59 mm, respectively) and narrower (12.1, 10.68, 10.90, and 8.55 mm, respectively). The thickness of the rotator cable was significantly positively correlated with the rotator cuff thickness in the normal rotator cuffs (coefficient, 0.49; P = 0.010) and tendinosis of SST-ISTs (coefficient, 0.53; P < 0.001), but was not correlated with patients' age. Conclusion: On sagittal plane of indirect MR arthrography, most rotator cables were visible. The appearance of the rotator cable changed according to the rotator cuff condition.

"A wind turbine emulator is an important hardware to simulate wind energy conversion systems. The emulator hardware is often built by a coupled motor as prime mover and controlled by a variable speed drive to the shaft of an electrical generator. In this work, we propose, design and implement a novel wind turbine emulator by using a squirrel cage induction machine and permanent magnet induction generator. The control of the prime mover is performed by an IGBT AC drive. The drive itself is controlled by a 32-bit microprocessor. Furthermore, the computer supervises the drive and generates the wind patterns and sets the configuration of wind turbine models. This allows the user to define different wind patterns and to emulate different wind turbines. The combination of the PI controller, the computer supervision, and the microprocessor ensures an accurate performance of entire system. The frequency of the generated voltage is proportional to the shaft rotational speed. Therefore, the output voltage frequency is used as a rotational speed meter. RS-485 is the main communication channel between the drive and the computer. Finally, the results demonstrate the effective and accurate performance of the proposed emulator in reproducing the dynamics of an actual wind turbine. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Because water is a key at-risk resource, improved water management is essential. In terms of quantity, the two major alternatives in water management can be grouped into: (i) improving efficiency in water use; and (ii) exploring alternative water sources. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is one of the most promising alternative water sources, since rainwater can easily be collected and used without significant treatment for non-potable purposes. However, the economical viability of these systems is not always assured. This paper examines the most relevant technical and economical issues in designing domestic RWH systems, evaluating the technical feasibility and economical viability of this technology in the particular weather and water use in Portugal. The evaluation is performed for a single-family residence, where the water use pattern was monitored. The precipitation pattern is characterized for two locations in Portugal, Porto and Almada, since they represent two different scenarios for RWH. The RWH and water savings efficiency were assessed and payback period estimated for both cities. It was found that, for an optimum rainwater tank, the water savings potential are similar for both locations, despite the differences in the average annual precipitation. A simple rule for estimating the optimum tank capacity for single-family households in Portugal is proposed. A sensitivity analysis shows an important influence of water fees on the economical viability of RWH systems in single-family houses in Portugal, namely when compared to changes in the consumption pattern.

"AimIt has been reported that many people with dementia require hospitalizations. The objective of the present study was to determine predictive factors for hospitalizations in people with dementia. MethodsA total of 70 individuals with dementia living in a veterans' home in southern Taiwan were consecutively enrolled. During prospective follow up, all hospitalization events were recorded. ResultsThe mean age of residents with dementia was 86.14.0years, and the mean follow-up time for this population was 2.2 +/- 1.1years. Among individuals, 62.9% suffered from malnutrition or were at risk of malnutrition (minimal nutritional assessment-short form score 11), and 8.6% of individuals had a body mass index of <18.5Kg/m(2). There were 52 (74.3%) individuals who had previously fallen. Overall, 51 of 70 residents were hospitalized during the follow-up period. In those individuals with previous falls, there was a significantly increased risk of hospitalization (odds ratio 5.61, 95% CI 1.18-26.7). Furthermore, three factors were significantly associated with the risk of fall, including handgrip strength, malnutrition and Mini-Mental State Examination score. ConclusionsThe results of the present study showed that hospitalization was a frequent event in residents with dementia living in a long-term care facility. The major predictor for hospital admission was history of a previous fall. Screening those with dementia for history of injurious falls and associated risk factors for falling could help identify those at risk of hospitalization, thus necessitating a comprehensive intervention to reduce hospitalization.

"AIM To study mucosal addressin cellular adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for the assessment of murine colitis and carcinogenesis. METHODS C57BL/6 mice were challenged with 3% dextran sodium-sulfate (DSS) for three, six or nine days to study the development of acute colitis. Ultrasound was performed with and without the addition of unspecific contrast agents. MAdCAM-1-targeted contrast agent was used to detect and quantify MAdCAM-1 expression. Inflammatory driven colorectal azoxymethane (AOM)/DSS-induced carcinogenesis was examined on day 42 and 84 using VEGF-targeted contrast agent. Highly specific tissue echogenicity was quantified using specialized software. Sonographic findings were correlated to tissue staining, western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry to quantify the degree of inflammation and stage of carcinogenesis. RESULTS Native ultrasound detected increased general bowel wall thickening that correlated with more progressed and more severe DSS-colitis (healthy mice: 0.3 mm +/- 0.03 vs six days DSS: 0.5 mm +/- 0.2 vs nine days DSS: 0.6 mm +/- 0.2, P < 0.05). Moreover, these sonographic findings correlated well with clinical parameters such as weight loss (r(2) = 0.74) and histological damage (r(2) = 0.86) (P < 0.01). In acute DSS-induced murine colitis, CEUS targeted against MAdCAM-1 detected and differentiated stages of mild, moderate and severe colitis via calculation of mean pixel contrast intensity in decibel (9.6 dB +/- 1.6 vs 12.9 dB +/- 1.4 vs 18 dB +/- 3.33, P < 0.05). Employing the AOM/DSS-induced carcinogenesis model, tumor development was monitored by CEUS targeted against VEGF and detected a significantly increased echogenicity in tumors as compared to adjacent healthy mucosa (healthy mucosa, 1.6 dB +/- 1.4 vs 42 d, 18.2 dB +/- 3.3 vs 84 d, 18.6 dB +/- 4.9, P < 0.01). Tissue echogenicity strongly correlated with histological analysis and immunohistochemistry findings (VEGF-positive cells in 10 high power fields of healthy mucosa: 1 +/- 1.2 vs 42 d after DSS start: 2.4 +/- 1.6 vs 84 d after DSS start: 3.5 +/- 1.3, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION Molecularly targeted CEUS is a highly specific and non-invasive imaging modality, which characterizes murine intestinal inflammation and carcinogenesis in vivo.

"As the world's population continues to grow, water pollution is presenting one of the biggest challenges worldwide. More wastewater is being generated and the demand for clean water is increasing. To ensure the safety and health of humans and the environment, highly efficient wastewater treatment systems, and a reliable assessment of water quality and pollutants are required. The advance of holistic approaches to water quality management and the increasing use of ecological water treatment technologies, such as constructed wetlands and waste stabilisation ponds (WSPs), challenge the appropriateness of commonly used water quality indicators. Instead, additional indicators, which are direct measures of the processes involved in the stabilisation of human waste, have to be established to provide an in-depth understanding of system performance. In this study we identified the sterol composition of wastewater treated in WSPs and assessed the suitability of human sterol levels as a bioindicator of treatment efficiency of wastewater in WSPs. As treatment progressed in WSPs, the relative abundance of human faecal sterols, such as coprostanol, epicoprostanol, 24-ethylcoprostanol, and sitostanol decreased significantly and the sterol composition in wastewater changed significantly. Furthermore, sterol levels were found to be correlated with commonly used wastewater quality indicators, such as BOD, TSS and E. coli. Three of the seven sterol ratios that have previously been used to track sewage pollution in the environment, detected a faecal signal in the effluent of WSPs, however, the others were influenced by high prevalence of sterols originating from algal and fungal activities. This finding poses a concern for environmental assessment studies, because environmental pollution from waste stabilisation ponds can go unnoticed. In conclusion, faecal sterols and their ratios can be used as reliable indicators of treatment efficiency and water quality during wastewater treatment in WSPs. They can complement the use of commonly used indicators of water quality, to provide essential information on the overall performance of ponds and whether a pond is underperforming in terms of stabilising human waste. Such a holistic understanding is essential when the aim is to improve the performance of a treatment plant, build new plants or expand existing infrastructure. Future work should aim at further establishing the use of sterols as reliable water quality indicators on a broader scale across natural and engineered systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"A system identification approach can be incorporated in groundwater time series analysis, revealing information concerning the local hydrogeological situation. The aim of this work was to analyse water table fluctuations in an outcrop area of the Guarani Aquifer System (GAS) in Brotas/SP, Brazil, using data from a groundwater monitoring network. The water table dynamic was modelled using continuous time series models that reference the hydrogeological system upon which they operate. The model's climatological inputs of precipitation and evapotranspiration generate impulse response (IR) functions with parameters that can be related to the physical conditions concerning the hydrological processes involved. The interpretation of the model parameters from two sets of monitoring wells selected at different land-use sites is presented, exemplifying the effect of different water table depths and the distance to the nearest drainage location. Systematic trends of water table depths were also identified from model parameters at specific periods and related to plant development, crop harvest and land-use changes.

"As a fundamental optimization problem, the vehicle routing problem has wide application backgrounds and has been paid lots of attentions in past decades. In this paper we study its applications in data gathering and wireless energy charging for wireless sensor networks, by devising improved approximation algorithms for it and its variants. The key ingredients in the algorithm design include exploiting the combinatorial properties of the problems and making use of tree decomposition and minimum weighted maximum matching techniques. Specifically, given a metric complete graph G and an integer k >0, we consider rootless, uncapacitated rooted, and capacitated rooted min-max cycle cover problems in G with an aim to find k rootless (or rooted) edge-disjoint cycles covering the vertices in V such that the maximum cycle weight among the k cycles is minimized. For each of the mentioned problems, we develop an improved approximate solution. That is, for the rootless min-max cycle cover problem, we develop a (5 1/3 + epsilon)-approximation algorithm; for the uncapacitated rooted min-max cycle cover problem, we devise a (6 1/3 + epsilon)-approximation algorithm; and for the capacitated rooted min-max cycle cover problem, we propose a (7 + epsilon)-approximation algorithm. These algorithms improve the best existing approximation ratios of the corresponding problems 6 + epsilon, 7 + epsilon, and 13 + epsilon, respectively, where epsilon is a constant with 0 < + < 1. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through experimental simulations. Experimental results show that the actual approximation ratios delivered by the proposed algorithms are always no more than 2, much better than their analytical counterparts.

"Advancements in microelectronics and software allow the use of embedded systems in the implementation of some control laws. In this work, the STM32 microcontroller is exploited in order to implement a robust fixed low-order controller on an electronic system. Parametric uncertainty model is employed to describe the system behavior, and the controller objective is to guarantee some time response specifications in the presence of model uncertainties. The controller design is expressed as a min-max non-convex optimization problem while taking into account the desired closed-loop performances and uncertainties. Accordingly, with the aim of obtaining an optimal solution and then an optimal control law, the application of a global optimization method is recommended. In this work, the exploited global optimization method is the generalized geometric programming. The implementation of a proportional integral controller, a proportional integral derivative controller and the fixed low-order controller shows the efficiency of the latter one.

"Aim: to provide an overview of the traumatic injuries sustained by players in the 2015 America Cup. Material and methods: we collected the medical reports on all the matches held during the 2015 America Cup, in Chile, in 2015. Twelve American teams took part in the championship, consisted of 26 matches with a total of 276 players. The physician for each team sent a request form of the traumatic injuries sustained, including the time at which the injury was produced, the location and diagnosis, its severity and the circumstances (contact injury, sanction, treatment required). Results: the mean number of minutes played was 233 (SD: 147) (5-570) minutes. An injury occurred every 58 minutes, which means that there were 17.25 injuries per 1,000 minutes of match time. We found 44 injuries in 30 players. There were 14 non-contact injuries, and 30 contact injuries, of which 13 were declared fouls and resulted in cards being given. Five teams had one injured player, two had 2, two had 4, and one had 25 injuries. The most frequent injuries were those to the lower limbs. The muscles strains happened in the second part of the second half of the match, the ACL rupture at the end of the first half, and the other sprains and strains in the second half. The contusions occurred at all times throughout the match, although they seemed to be concentrated towards the end of the first half, while the cases of tendinitis were caused in the first part of the second half. Conclusion: football injuries are very common, and even though serious injuries are rare, it is increasingly necessary to set protocols for action which ensure good medical attention at all levels to address the problems that arise, both during training and in competitions, and to be prepared to treat serious injuries if these occur.

"Atmospheric water vapor plays an important role in hydrologic cycle and climate change of the Earth. A number of studies have focused on retrieval of the total precipitable water (TPW) using microwave or optical remote sensing. In this paper, the global quarter-degree gridded TPW over land was retrieved using water vapor sensitivity parameter Delta Tb-18.7/Delta Tb-23.8 based on the combination of AMSR-E and MODIS observations. There are two major improvements in the retrieval algorithm, including optimization of the estimation model of surface emissivity Delta epsilon(18.7)/Delta epsilon(23.8) and correction of the terrain influence to the retrieval of TPW using DEM. To obtain a high resolution TPW, we also developed an algorithm to downscale the retrieved quarter-degree gridded TPW to a fine scale of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees using DEM and NDVI. In addition, the downscaled TPW was further calibrated using high precision TPW from MODIS in the clear-sky condition to improve its accuracy. Finally, both quarter-degree and 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees gridded TPW were validated against SuomiNet GPS retrieved TPW on a global scale. The RMSE for the retrieved quarter-degree gridded global TPW is 3.45 mm, with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. In addition, the RMSE for the downscaled 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees gridded global TPW is 4.18 mm, with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. An obvious advantage of our algorithm compared with MODIS TPW product is that it can retrieve TPW under cloudy sky condition over land. The algorithm developed in this study can be easily transferred to AMSR2 on board GCOM-W1 and provides the long-term global daily TPW over land since the launch of Aqua to present day to support hydrologic cycle and climate change studies.

"Aim: Calcium channel blockers are widely used in cardiovascular diseases. Besides L-type channels, T-and P/Q-type calcium channels are involved in the contraction of human renal blood vessels. It was hypothesized that T-and P/Q-type channels are involved in the contraction of human brain and mammary blood vessels. Methods: Internal mammary arteries from bypass surgery patients and cerebral arterioles from patients with brain tumours with and without hypertension were tested in a myograph and perfusion set-up. PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed on isolated blood vessels. Results: The P/Q-type antagonist x-agatoxin IVA (10(-8) mol L-1) and the T-type calcium blocker mibefradil (10(-7) mol L-1) inhibited KCl depolarization- induced contraction in mammary arteries from hypertensive patients with no effect on blood vessels from normotensive patients. omega-Agatoxin IVA decreased contraction in cerebral arterioles from hypertensive patients. L-type blocker nifedipine abolished the contraction in mammary arteries. PCR analysis showed expression of P/Q-type (Ca(v)2.1), Ttype (Ca(v)3.1 and Ca(v)3.2) and L-type (Ca(v)1.2) calcium channels in mammary and cerebral arteries. Immunohistochemical labelling of mammary and cerebral arteries revealed the presence of Cav2.1 in endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Cav3.1 was also detected in mammary arteries. Conclusion: P/Q- and T-type Ca-v are present in human internal mammary arteries and in cerebral penetrating arterioles.

"Aim: The objective of the present meta-analysis was to investigate whether or not cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) polymorphisms are associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) susceptibility. Methods: A systematic search was conducted from the PubMed, ENBASE, and Springer link database up to April 2014. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to assess the strength of association between CTLA-4 (+49 A/G) and AS risk. A subgroup analysis based on geographic region and a sensitivity analysis were also conducted. Results: Five studies were eligible for meta-analysis, including 918 cases and 845 controls. The results showed that no significant association was found between AS and CTLA-4 (+49 A/G) for the additive model (G vs. A), dominant model (GG+AG vs. AA), co-dominant model (GG vs. AA, AG vs. AA) and recessive model (GG vs. AG+AA). The OR was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.87-1.38), 1.16 (95% CI, 0.89-1.51), 1.05 (95% CI, 0.75-1.46), 1.15 (95% CI, 0.86-1.52) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.79-1.23), respectively. Although subgroup analysis demonstrated no association between CTLA-4 (+49 A/G) polymorphisms and susceptibility to AS in Europe and Taiwan, an association was found in Iran through both the co-dominant and dominant models. Exclusion of any individual study did not alter the significance of the final outcome, excepting the result by omitting the study by Huang etal. Conclusions: The present results suggest that the CTLA-4 may not be a major susceptibility locus in humans with AS. The relationship between them may be affected by different geographic populations.

"Aeolian sand transport results from interactions between the ground surface and airflow. Previous research has focused on the effects on sand entrainment and mass transport of surface features and wind velocity, but the influence of air density, which strongly constrains airflow characteristics and the resulting sand flow, has not been widely considered. In the present study, entrainment, saltation characteristics and transport rates were examined at nine experimental sites ranging in elevation from -154m below sea-level (Aiding Lake) to 5076m above sea-level (Tanggula Mountain pass on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau). At each site, a portable wind tunnel and high-speed camera system were set up, and the friction wind velocity, threshold friction velocity and sand flow structure were observed systematically. For a given volumetric airflow, lower air density increases the wind velocity. Low air density also creates a high threshold friction velocity. The Bagnold wind erosion threshold model remains valid, but the value of empirical parameter A decreased with decreasing air density and ranged from 010 to 007, the smallest values reported in the literature. For a given wind velocity, increased altitude reduced total sand transport and creeping, but the saltation rate and saltation height increased. The present results provide insights into the fundamental mechanisms of the initiation and transport of sand by wind in regions with an extreme temperature or altitude (for example, alpine deserts and low-lying lake basins) or on other planets, including Mars. These results also provide theoretical support for improved sand-control engineering measures. The data and empirical equations provided in this paper improve the ability to estimate threshold and transport conditions for wind-blown sand.

Results demonstrate that the variation of internally resonant band gaps induced by the alteration of the piezoelectric patches to those positions and mechanical properties, can be precisely estimated by simple heuristic models proposed according to deformation characteristics of standing wave modes. This founding could promote the practical implementation of the highly connected honeycombs in the adaptive control to elastic wave.

"As a well-known clustering algorithm, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) allows each input sample to belong to more than one cluster, providing more flexibility than non-fuzzy clustering methods. However, the accuracy of FCM is subject to false detections caused by noisy records, weak feature selection and low certainty of the algorithm in some cases. The false detections are very important in some decision-making application domains like network security and medical diagnosis, where weak decisions based on such false detections may lead to catastrophic outcomes. They mainly emerge from making decisions about a subset of records that do not provide sufficient evidence to make a good decision. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting such ambiguous records in FCM by introducing a certainty factor to decrease invalid detections. This approach enables us to send the detected ambiguous records to another discrimination method for a deeper investigation, thus increasing the accuracy by lowering the error rate. Most of the records are still processed quickly and with low error rate preventing performance loss which is common in similar hybrid methods. Experimental results of applying the proposed method on several datasets from different domains show a significant decrease in error rate as well as improved sensitivity of the algorithm.

"Automated environmental compliance checking requires automated extraction of rules from environmental regulatory textual documents such as energy conservation codes and EPA regulations. Automated rule extraction requires complex text processing and analysis for information extraction and subsequent formalization of the extracted information into computer-processable rules. In the proposed automated compliance checking (ACC) approach, the text is first classified into predefined categories before information extraction (IE). The advantages are that irrelevant text will be filtered out during text classification (TC) and text with similar semantic meaning will be grouped, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of further IE and compliance reasoning (CR). The categories used for TC are predefined in a semantic TC topic hierarchy, and the classified text is subsequently used in semantic IE and semantic CR. This paper presents the proposed machine learning (ML)-based TC algorithm for classifying clauses in environmental regulatory documents based on the TC topic hierarchy. In developing the algorithm, different text preprocessing techniques, ML algorithms, and performance improvement strategies were tested and used. The final TC algorithm was tested on 10 environmental regulatory documents and evaluated in terms of precision and recall. The algorithm achieved approximately 97 and 84% average recall and precision, respectively, on the testing data.

"Aim: Oxytocin regulates food intake, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and urinary sodium excretion. We assessed the association between serum oxytocin levels and presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in older men. Methods: Cross-sectional study was performed in 540 volunteer men aged 50-85 yrs from the MINOS cohort. Oxytocin was measured in fasting serum by radioimmunoassay (Oxytocin RIA, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals). MetS was diagnosed using the harmonized definition. Results: Serum oxytocin was higher in 166 men with MetS vs. controls (p < 0.005). After adjustment for confounders including leptin, higher oxytocin was associated with higher odds of MetS (OR = 1.38 per SD, 95% CI: 1.10-1.71, p0.74 pg/mL (median) had higher odds of MetS vs. men with oxytocin 60.74 pg/mL (OR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.33-3.18, p0.74 pg/mL and total testosterone < 300 ng/dL (< 10.4 nmol/L) had higher odds of MetS vs. men without these characteristics (OR = 3.95, 95% CI: 1.65-9.46, p < 0.005). Men having 25-hydroxycholecalciferol levels0.74 pg/mL had higher odds of MetS vs. men without these characteristics (OR = 2.86, 95% CI: 1.47-5.58, p0.74 pg/mL and osteocalcin levels < 14.6 ng/mL (lowest quartile) had higher odds of MetS vs. men without these characteristics (OR = 4.12, 95% CI: 2.07-8.20, p < 0.001). Conclusion: In older men, higher serum oxytocin levels are associated with higher odds of MetS regardless of potential confounders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

"As one of the most developed intelligent operating systems on mobile devices, Android has taken the most part of the cell phone market. A rapid increase in the number of mobile applications make them more and more relevant to people's daily lives than ever before. Due to Android's security mechanism and the validation lack of publishing Android apps, Android malware detection still remains to be a critical issue. To solve this problem, this paper found that the statistical information of Android components (mainly activity) from the Manifest file cannot be ignored, based on the traditional method of Android permission detection. In this paper, a new feature vector is extracted from the AndroidManifest file, which combines the permission information and the component information of the Android application. We combine the naive Bias classification algorithm, and propose a malicious application detection method based on AndroidManifest file information. The experimental results show that the new method performance better than that of the traditional permission detection.

"Aim. To evaluate the efficiency of interferon (IFN) therapy in patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV). Subjects and methods. A total of 61 patients (41 with ET and 20 with PV) were examined. Prior to study enrolment, 44 (72%) patients with ET or PV received one or other therapy (aspirin was not taken into account). The mean Jak2V617F mutant allele at baseline was 23% (6-54%) in the patients with ET and 40% (11-88%) in those with PV. The median time from diagnosis to enrollment was 49 months. Results. The paper presents the clinical and molecular findings of long-term INF-alpha therapy in patients with ET or PV. The median follow-up was 52 months. Recombinant IFN-alpha(2) showed its ability to induce complete hematologic remission (ET (76%), PV (70%)) and a complete molecular response. 22 (69%) out of 32 patients were noted to have a smaller number of cells with the Jak2V617F mutation. In the patients with PV and in those with ET, the relative reduction in the proportion of cells with the Jak2V617F mutant gene averaged 85% and 56% of the baseline values, respectively. There was a reduction in the proportion of cells expressing the Jak2V617F mutation in, both the ET (from 12 to 2.2%; p=0.001) and PV (from 32.7% to 3.2%) groups (p=0.001). Ten (31%) patients achieved a deep molecular remission (<= 2% Jak2V617F allele); among them, 5 patients were not found to have Jak2V617F mutation. The obtained molecular response remained in 7 of the 10 patients untreated for 11 to 86 months. The long-term treatment with IFN-alpha led to normalization of the morphological pattern of bone marrow in 5 of the 7 PV or ET patients. Conclusion. Significant molecular remissions achieved by therapy with recombinant interferon -alpha(2) confirm the appropriateness of this treatment option in in the majority of patients with ET or PV.

"Automated regulatory compliance checking requires automated extraction of requirements from regulatory textual documents and their formalization in a computer-processable rule representation. Such information extraction (IE) is a challenging task that requires complex analysis and processing of text. Natural language processing (NLP) aims to enable computers to process natural language text in a human-like manner. This paper proposes a semantic, rule-based NLP approach for automated IE from construction regulatory documents. The proposed approach uses a set of pattern-matching-based IE rules and conflict resolution (CR) rules in IE. A variety of syntactic (syntax/grammar-related) and semantic (meaning/context-related) text features are used in the patterns of the IE and CR rules. Phrase structure grammar (PSG)-based phrasal tags and separation and sequencing of semantic information elements are proposed and used to reduce the number of needed patterns. An ontology is used to aid in the recognition of semantic text features (concepts and relations). The proposed IE algorithms were tested in extracting quantitative requirements from the 2009 International Building Code and achieved 0.969 and 0.944 precision and recall, respectively.

"Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most disabling diseases to affect large numbers of elderly people worldwide. Because of the characteristics of this disease, patients with AD require daily assistance from service providers both in nursing homes and at home. Domiciliary assistance has been demonstrated to be cost effective and efficient in the first phase of the disease, helping to slow down the course of the illness, improve the quality of life and care, and extend independence for patients and caregivers. In this context, the aim of this work is to demonstrate the technical effectiveness and acceptability of an innovative domiciliary smart sensor system for providing domiciliary assistance to patients with AD which has been developed with an Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) approach. Methods: The design, development, testing, and evaluation of the innovative technological solution were performed by a multidisciplinary team. In all, 15 sociomedical operators and 14 patients with AD were directly involved in defining the end-users' needs and requirements, identifying design principles with acceptability and usability features and evaluating the technological solutions before and after the real experimentation. Results: A modular technological system was produced to help caregivers continuously monitor the health status, safety, and daily activities of patients with AD. During the experimentation, the acceptability, utility, usability, and efficacy of this system were evaluated as quite positive. Conclusion: The experience described in this article demonstrated that AAL technologies are feasible and effective nowadays and can be actively used in assisting patients with AD in their homes. The extensive involvement of caregivers in the experimentation allowed to assess that there is, through the use of the technological system, a proven improvement in care performance and efficiency of care provision by both formal and informal caregivers and consequently an increase in the quality of life of patients, their relatives, and their caregivers.

"As the basic part of the mechanical transmission, gears should have high transmission accuracy, so the gear's precision measurement is a key technology. Based on the existing research, the computer vision technology is introduced in gear test. According to the definitions of technical indexes, such as pitch deviation, tooth thickness deviation, etc., through analysis and research, a new measurement method is proposed, so as to complete the determination of the modulus, tooth number and total accumulated pitch deviation of a gear. In the proposed methods, those indexes such as the pitch and tooth thickness, are measured in arc length, rather than in chordal length, so that they are consistent with their definitions. And the measured points can be positioned on the reference circle of a gear while the pitch and total accumulative pitch deviations are examined. Finally, a gear is measured with the proposed method. The main test is obtained as follows. The single pitch deviation is 10,3 mu m, total cumulative pitch deviation is 44,8 mu m, and tooth thick deviation is 5,2 mu m. The experiment demonstrates that the proposed method is feasible and effective, and can meet the precision need of engineering practice. This study provides a new solution method for the gear's on-line measurement.

"Aim: Chronic health conditions are associated with poor academic outcomes. This study examines the relationship between health conditions, specialist health service utilisation and academic performance in Australian children. Methods: This was a quasi-longitudinal study where School Entrant Health Questionnaire (a survey tool with parent report on children's health) data for 24 678 children entering school in 2008 was matched with the 2011 National Assessment Program - Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN). Linear and logistic regressions were used to examine associations between health conditions, use of a specialist health service and reading and numeracy scores. Results: The study comprised 24 678 children. Children with allergies, very low birth weight, developmental delay, diabetes, spina bifida, cystic fibrosis, birth abnormality, speech problems, intellectual disability and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder had lower numeracy scores than those without any of these conditions (P < 0.05). The same children had higher odds (1.2-5.8) of being at or below the national minimum standard for numeracy. Children with developmental delay, epilepsy, dental problems, speech, intellectual disabilities and low birth weight had lower reading scores than those without these conditions (P < 0.05) and had higher odds of being at (odds ratio: 1.3) or below (odds ratio: 3.7) the national minimum standard for reading. Children with health conditions who had ever accessed specialist health services did not differ in their academic performance from those that had not used specialist health services. Conclusions: Some health conditions put children at risk of poorer academic performance, and interventions to prevent this such as appropriate support services in schools should be considered.
