"A hardware accelerator is presented to compute the probabilistic inference for a Bayesian network (BN) in distributed sensing applications. For energy efficiency, the accelerator is operated at a near-threshold voltage of 0.5 V, while achieving a maximum clock frequency of 33 MHz. Clique-tree message passing algorithm is leveraged to compute the probabilistic inference. The theoretical maximum size of a factor that the proposed hardware accelerator can handle is 2((8x20)=160) entries, which is sufficient for handling massive BNs, such as PATHFINDER, MUNIN, and so on (>1000 nodes). A Logical Alarm Reduction Mechanism (ALARM) BN is used to benchmark the performance of the accelerator. The accelerator consumes 76 nJ to execute the ALARM network using a clique-tree message-passing algorithm, while the same algorithm executed on an ultralow-power microcontroller consumes 20 mJ.

"An automatized procedure for the parameterization of fundamental equations of state (EOS) that are explicit in terms of the Helmholtz energy and are based on molecular simulation data is presented. The simulation runs are carried out via a cloud-based framework that combines multiple, distributed computing resources. A user-friendly graphical user interface ensures that minimal knowledge about the background operations is required.

"A parallel time integration method for nonlinear partial differential equations is proposed. It is based on a new implementation of the Paraexp method for linear partial differential equations (PDEs) employing a block Krylov subspace method. For nonlinear PDEs the algorithm is based on our Paraexp implementation within a waveform relaxation. The initial value problem is solved iteratively on a complete time interval. Nonlinear terms are treated as source terms, provided by the solution from the previous iteration. At each iteration, the problem is decoupled into independent subproblems by the principle of superposition. The decoupled subproblems are solved fast by exponential integration, based on a block Krylov method. The new time integration is demonstrated for the one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation and the viscous Burgers equation. Numerical experiments confirm excellent parallel scaling for the linear advection-diffusion problem, and good scaling in case the nonlinear Burgers equation is simulated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"A redundant system of collocated geodetic sensors and an accelerometer were used to measure the displacements of a stiff, 40-m-long footbridge excited by essentially vertical synchronized jumps. A main output of the measurements was that excitations produced vertical deflections (of the order of several mm), lateral deflections with an amplitude about half that of the vertical, an effect known for various bridges, and also smaller-scale longitudinal deflections, probably induced by the vertical ones. This combination of deflections in three axes is not an artifact of measuring errors, or of limitations of specific instruments, and do not reflect random effects, for they have been observed in different experiments by different sensors (Global Navigation Satellite System-GNSS, i.e., Global Positioning System-GPS plus the Russian Global Navigation Satellite System-GLONASS), robotic total stations-RTS (or robotic theodolite), and an accelerometer, and were tested through control of the measurement errors from time series reflecting no bridge oscillations. In all cases, sensors provided similar estimates of deflections and of deflection-derived dominant frequencies, which were found equal to those derived from the accelerometer. The proposed instrumentation and methodology seem suitable to control deflections of bridges in cases that visibility of satellites is poor or is disrupted by vehicle circulation. Measurement-based modeling of bridges described might be useful for understanding the structural behavior of bridges under several types of dynamic loads and can contribute to the displacement-based design of structures.

"After intense scientific exploration and more than a decade of failed trials, Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a fatal global epidemic. A traditional research and drug development paradigm continues to target heterogeneous late-stage clinically phenotyped patients with single 'magic bullet' drugs. Here, we propose that it is time for a paradigm shift towards the implementation of precision medicine (PM) for enhanced risk screening, detection, treatment, and prevention of AD. The overarching structure of how PM for AD can be achieved will be provided through the convergence of breakthrough technological advances, including big data science, systems biology, genomic sequencing, blood-based biomarkers, integrated disease modeling and P4 medicine. It is hypothesized that deconstructing AD into multiple genetic and biological subsets existing within this heterogeneous target population will provide an effective PM strategy for treating individual patients with the specific agent(s) that are likely to work best based on the specific individual biological make-up. The Alzheimer's Precision Medicine Initiative (APMI) is an international collaboration of leading interdisciplinary clinicians and scientists devoted towards the implementation of PM in Neurology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience. It is hypothesized that successful realization of PM in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases will result in breakthrough therapies, such as in oncology, with optimized safety profiles, better responder rates and treatment responses, particularly through biomarker-guided early preclinical disease-stage clinical trials.

"A current major challenge in leprosy control is the prevention of permanent disabilities. Host pathological inflammatory responses termed type 1 reaction (T1R) are a leading cause of nerve damage for leprosy patients. The environmental or inherited factors that predispose leprosy cases to undergo T1R are not known. However, studies have shown an important contribution of host genetics for susceptibility to T1R. We have previously identified variants encompassing the TNFSF15/TNFSF8 genes as T1R risk factors in a Vietnamese sample and replicated this association in a Brazilian sample. However, we failed to validate in Brazilian patients the strong association of TNFSF15/TNFSF8 markers rs6478108 and rs7863183 with T1R that we had observed in Vietnamese patients. Here, we investigated if the lack of validation of these variants was due to age-dependent effects on association using four independent population samples, two from Brazil and two from Vietnam. In the combined analysis across the four samples, we observed a strong association of the TNFSF15/TNFSF8 variants rs6478108, rs7863183, and rs3181348 with T1R (p(combined) = 1.5E-05, p(combined) = 1.8E-05, and p(combined) = 6.5E-06, respectively). However, the association of rs6478108 with T1R was more pronounced in leprosy cases under 30 years of age compared to the global sample [odds ratio (OR) = 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.54-2.46, p(combined) = 2.5E-08 versus OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.23-1.73, p(combined) = 1.5E-05]. A multivariable analysis indicated that the association of rs6478108 with T1R was independent of either rs7863183 or rs3181348. These three variants are known regulators of the TNFSF8 gene transcription level in multiple tissues. The age dependency of association of rs6478108 and T1R suggests that the genetic control of gene expression varies across the human life span.

"Action recognition, aiming to automatically classify actions from a series of observations, has attracted more attention in the computer vision community. The state-of-the-art action recognition methods utilize dense sampled trajectories to build feature representations. However, their performances are limited due to action region clutters and camera motions in real world applications. No matter how the scenario changes in different backgrounds, the salient cues of actions are highly dependent on their appearances and motions. Based on this discovery, in this paper we propose a novel saliency-based dense sampling strategy named improved dense trajectories (iDT) on salient region-based contrast boundary (iDT-RCB). Without any external human detector, a robust mask is generated to overcome the limitations of global contrast based saliency in action sequences. Warped optical flow is exploited to adjust the interest points sampling to remove subtle motions. We show that an appropriate pruning of feature points can achieve a good balance between saliency and density of the sampled points. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. More specifically, the fusion of deep-learned features and our hand-crafted features can even improve the recognition performance over baseline dense sampling methods. In particular, the fusion scheme achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy at 73.8% and 94.8% on Hollywood2 and UCF50, respectively.

"A diversity antenna system with antennas embedded in rear view mirrors of a vehicle is proposed for satellite digital audio radio system. Antenna diversity is needed because hidden antennas exhibit limited capability and composite body vehicles have poor reception due to no ground plane availability. Pattern gain diversity achieved with the proposed system is proven with on-vehicle antenna simulations and gain measurements. Selection combining diversity receiver architecture is also proposed and the system is tested in real time under two fading scenarios: weak satellite signal in dense foliage and multipath terrestrial environment with frequent satellite blockages. In both cases, the diversity system outperformed the reference antenna system with less mutes times (0.6% versus 0.8% in multipath, 0.1% versus 0.25% in dense foliage) and Reed-Solomon block errors (1.75% versus 2.18% in multipath, 0.87% versus 1.18% in dense foliage). The proposed rear-view mirror location is ideal for minimum signal degradation compared to windshield, backlite, and dashboard antenna installations.

"A new model of power-assisted bicycle has been designed, set up and tested. The main innovative solutions for the pedelec prototype are described in the present paper: the electric motor position; the new mechanical transmission; the low cost measurement system of the driving torque; the special test rig. Differently from a common approach, in which the electric motor is located on one of the three hubs of the bicycle, the idea of the pedelec prototype consists of an electrical motor in the central position that, by means of a bevel gear, transmits the torque on the central hub. The other innovative solution is represented by the motion transmission from the motor to the pedal shaft, achieved by two different gearboxes: the first one is a planetary gearbox and the second one is a simple bevel gear. The pedelec prototype contains also a new low cost measurement system of the driving torque based on a strain gauge load cell located on one side of the rear wheel, between the hub and the frame. Moreover, a commercial cycling simulator has been suitably modified in order to properly install the different sensors for the measurement of the performance of the pedelec. The test rig is able to reproduce an aforethought route or paths acquired during road tests, to measure the performance of the e-bike in terms of instantaneous power and speed. The experimental test rig can simulate the resistant torque of a predetermined track and it aims to test and to optimize the control strategy available on the electronic control unit. The authors have also conducted an environmental analysis of the developed pedelec, in particular comparing the e-bike with a thermal moped, in terms of environmental impact. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Frequency responses of three different ring resonator architectures are presented in the article.

"Ambient intelligence technologies are making our daily life increasingly virtual, and the boundary between the real world and the virtual world is gradually disappearing. Computer games are often played on the Internet, which allows people to enjoy games with others, even when they are not at the same location. This paper analyzes the Trading Card Game (TCG), which has two versions. One version is played with paper-based cards, whereas the other is played on a computer. The computer-based TCG supports remote play and has a number of enhancements, such as providing special fictional effects on virtual cards. The two different versions are useful to analyze the influence of virtuality in making future social interaction more playful. First, we investigate potential pitfalls to introduce virtuality in TCG through the scenario-based analysis, which adopts a player's personality to exploit potential difficulties. For investigating further insights on the influence of virtuality in TCG, we analyze some experiments with Augmented Trading Card Game, where a real opponent player is replaced with a fictional player. Our findings from the analyses show that the feeling of realness is essential to make incorporated virtuality successful. Recently some games' concepts can be adopted in order to augment our real world. It is essential to investigate the influence of virtuality introduced with the games. The future social interaction will incorporate virtuality based on a variety of game-like features to make the interaction more playful. Therefore, the insights described in this paper will be useful to help the design of future playful social interaction.

"Agitation associated with dementia is frequently reported clinically but has received little attention in preclinical models of dementia. The current study used a 7PA2 CM intracerebroventricular injection model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to assess acute memory impairment, and a bilateral intrahippocampal (IH) injection model of AD (aggregated A beta(1-42) injections) and a bilateral IH injection model of dementia with Lewy bodies (aggregated NAC(61-95) injections) to assess chronic memory impairment in the rat. An alternating-lever cyclic-ratio schedule of operant responding was used for data collection, where incorrect lever perseverations measured executive function (memory) and running response rates (RRR) measured behavioral output (agitation). The results indicate that bilateral IH injections of A beta(1-42) and bilateral IH injections of NAC(61-95) decreased memory function and increased RRRs, whereas intracerebroventricular injections of 7PA2 CM decreased memory function but did not increase RRRs. These findings show that using the aggregated peptide IH injection models of dementia to induce chronic neurotoxicity, memory decline was accompanied by elevated behavioral output. This demonstrates that IH peptide injection models of dementia provide a preclinical screen for pharmacological interventions used in the treatment of increased behavioral output (agitation), which also establish detrimental side effects on memory.

"A high degree of uncertainty associated with the emission inventory for China tends to degrade the performance of chemical transport models in predicting PM2.5 concentrations especially on a daily basis. In this study a novel machine learning algorithm, Geographically -Weighted Gradient Boosting Machine (GW-GBM), was developed by improving GBM through building spatial smoothing kernels to weigh the loss function. This modification addressed the spatial nonstationarity of the relationships between PM2.5 concentrations and predictor variables such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) and meteorological conditions. GW-GBM also overcame the estimation bias of PM2.5 concentrations due to missing AOD retrievals, and thus potentially improved subsequent exposure analyses. GW-GBM showed good performance in predicting daily PM2.5 concentrations (R-2 = 0.76, RMSE = 23.0 g/m(3)) even with partially missing AOD data, which was better than the original GBM model (R-2 = 0.71, RMSE = 25.3 g/m(3)). On the basis of the continuous spatiotemporal prediction of PM2.5 concentrations, it was predicted that 95% of the population lived in areas where the estimated annual mean PM2.5 concentration was higher than 35 g/m(3), and 45% of the population was exposed to PM2.5 >75 g/m(3) for over 100 days in 2014.

"A comprehensive ontology can ease the discovery, maintenance and popularization of knowledge in many domains. As a means to enhance existing ontologies, attribute extraction has attracted tremendous research attentions. However, most existing attribute extraction techniques focus on exploring a single type of sources, such as structured (e.g., relational databases), semi-structured (e.g., Extensible Markup Language (XML)) or unstructured sources (e.g., Web texts, images), which leads to the poor coverage of knowledge bases (KBs). This paper presents a framework for ontology augmentation by extracting attributes from four types of sources, namely existing knowledge bases (KBs), query stream, Web texts, and Document Object Model (DOM) trees. In particular, we use query stream and two major KBs, DBpedia and Freebase, to seed the attribute extraction from Web texts and DOM trees. We specially focus on exploring the extraction technique from DOM trees, which is rarely studied in previous works. Algorithms and a series of filters are developed. Experiments show the capability of our approach in augmenting existing KB ontology.

"A novel generalized pattern search (GPS)-based cellular automata (GPS-CA) model was developed to simulate urban land-use change in a GIS environment. The model is built on a fitness function that computes the difference between the observed results produced from remote-sensing images and the simulated results produced by a general CA model. GPS optimization incorporating genetic algorithms (GAs) searches for the minimum difference, i.e. the smallest accumulated residuals, in fitting the CA transition rules. The CA coefficients captured by the GPS method have clear physical meanings that are closely associated with the dynamic mechanisms of land-use change. The GPS-CA model was applied to simulate urban land-use change in Kunshan City in the Yangtze River Delta from 2000 to 2015. The results show that the GPS method had a smaller root mean squared error (0.2821) than a logistic regression (LR) method (0.5256) in fitting the CA transition rules. The GPS-CA model thus outperformed the LR-CA model, with an overall accuracy improvement of 4.7%. As a result, the GPS-CA model should be a superior tool for modeling land-use change as well as predicting future scenarios in response to different conditions to support the sustainable urban development.

"An important issue in Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is the massive deployment of intelligent agents embedded in the environment which are adaptive to the users' profiles, preferences and needs. This is why, the use of agent-oriented methodologies and frameworks is almost mandatory to easily develop software for AmI scenarios. ICARO is a software framework that promotes the use of different organizational and behavioral patterns to implement multi-agent systems (MAS). Its extensive use in several projects demonstrates a substantial increase in software productivity. Also, in order to reduce the coding effort it is usual to design MAS at a higher level. In this sense, code generation from MAS specifications into ICARO framework has been performed. INGENIAS Development Kit (IDK) supports both the specification of MAS models, including any feature required to implement MAS with ICARO, and a set of facilities for code generation. This paper describes the development of AmI applications thanks to the integration of ICARO and IDK. Two IDK modules have been developed, namely a ""code generation"" and a ""code update support"" module.

"Acute angioedema attacks are conventionally treated with antihistamines and steroids, in line with a presumed mechanism of disease involving overwhelming mast-cell degranulation. This approach overlooks a small but important minority of cases in which attacks are bradykinin driven and exhibit poor responsiveness to steroid or anti-histamine therapy. These patients may have a family history of angioedema (hereditary angioedema), or a past medical history including B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders or autoimmune disease (acquired angioedema). Rather than steroid therapy, they respond to administration of a bradykinin inhibitor, or more commonly, a Cl esterase inhibitor substitute, to control acute symptoms and reduce the probability of invasive airway insertion. In the long-term, they require Cl esterase inhibitor sparing therapy and a treat-the-cause approach to reduce the risk of recurrent attacks. We present here a case of a middle-aged woman who presented with recurrent angioedema of initially uncertain aetiology.

"A facile, controllable, inexpensive and green electrochemical synthesis of IrO2-graphene nanohybrid thin films is developed to fabricate an easyto-use integrated paper microfluidic electrochemical pH sensor for resource-limited settings. Taking advantages from both pH meters and strips, the pH sensing platform is composed of hydrophobic barrier-patterned paper micropad (mu PAD) using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), screen-printed electrode (SPE) modified with IrO2-graphene films and molded acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic holder. Repetitive cathodic potential cycling was employed for graphene oxide (GO) reduction which can completely remove electrochemically unstable oxygenated groups and generate a 2D defect-free homogeneous graphene thin film with excellent stability and electronic properties. A uniform and smooth IrO2 film in nanoscale grain size is anodically electrodeposited onto the graphene film, without any observable cracks. The resulting IrO2-RGO electrode showed slightly super-Nernstian responses from pH 2-12 in Britton-Robinson (B-R) buffers with good linearity, small hysteresis, low response time and reproducibility in different buffers, as well as low sensitivities to different interfering ionic species and dissolved oxygen. A simple portable digital pH meter is fabricated, whose signal is measured with a multimeter, using high input-impedance operational amplifier and consumer batteries. The pH values measured with the portable electrochemical paper-microfluidic pH sensors were consistent with those measured using a commercial laboratory pH meter with a glass electrode.

"Agarwood formation in Aquilaria malaccensis could be artificially stimulated by fungal infection. Furthermore, A. malaccensis adapts to this infection by developing typical included phloem boundary within xylem tissues. Naturally synthesized agarwood requires a lengthy process of up to 30 years, which impedes its continuous production. Therefore, recent effort has been allocated to the elucidation of agarwood formation to stimulate its process rapidly. In this study, we artificially induced agarwood formation by injection and inoculation of cultivated Aquilaria malaccensis with four strains of Fusarium solani isolated from different places in Indonesia. The results showed that A. malaccensis responded differently upon wounding and fungal inoculations compared to healthy trees. All wounded and inoculated samples resulted in the formation of typical discoloration zone surrounding injection sites. Further anatomical observation revealed that both samples also developed included phloem structures in which resinous agarwood compounds were accumulated. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the inoculated samples yielded some important agarwood compounds such as tridecanoic acid, alpha-santalol, and spathulenol, which were not present in both healthy controls and only wounded samples. Notably, one of the tested F. solani, strain Gorontalo displayed promising results as a candidate for artificially induced agarwood formation in A. malaccensis in terms of color, odor, and chemical constituents.

"A complexity of business dynamics often forces decision-makers to make decisions based on subjective mental models, reflecting their experience. However, research has shown that companies perform better when they apply data-driven decision-making. This creates an incentive to introduce intelligent, data based decision models, which are comprehensive and support the interactive evaluation of decision options necessary for the business environment. Recently, a new general explanation methodology has been proposed, which supports the explanation of state-of-the-art black-box prediction models. Uniform explanations are generated on the level of model/individual instance and support what-if analysis. We present a novel use of this methodology inside an intelligent system in a real-world case of business-to-business (B2B) sales forecasting, a complex task frequently done judgmentally. Users can validate their assumptions with the presented explanations and test their hypotheses using the presented what-if parallel graph representation. The results demonstrate effectiveness and usability of the methodology. A significant advantage of the presented method is the possibility to evaluate seller's actions and to outline general recommendations in sales strategy. This flexibility of the approach and easy-to-follow explanations are suitable for many different applications. Our well-documented real-world case shows how to solve a decision support problem, namely that the best performing black-box models are inaccessible to human interaction and analysis. This could extend the use of the intelligent systems to areas where they were so far neglected due to their insistence on comprehensible models. A separation of the machine learning model selection from model explanation is another significant benefit for expert and intelligent systems. Explanations unconnected to a particular prediction model positively influence acceptance of new and complex models in the business environment through their easy assessment and switching.

Pico-E abundance was shown to increase along the nutrient and pollution gradient from the coastal waters outside the bay (annual average of 7.3 +/- 5.4 x 10(3) cells mL(-1)) to the eastern corner of the bay (28.7 +/- 11.4 x 10(3) cells mL(-1)), while no relation was found between the water pollution status and Syn abundance (9.9 +/- 8.7 x 10(3) cells mL(-1); at all the stations, n = 27). Matter flows through the communities (daily production for Syn and Pico-E 0(-1)6.6 and 0(-1)9.3 A mu g C L-1 day(-1), respectively; grazing mortality for Syn and PicoE 0-3.6 and 0-21.2 A mu g C L-1 day(-1), respectively) were comparable to or even exceeded their biomass stocks (>0.05-6.8 and 0.9-26.5 A mu g C L-1 for Syn and PicoE, respectively), indicating high biomass turnover rates. The highest flow-to-stock ratio (up to 6 for Syn) and a significant imbalance between daily production (P) and grazing mortality (G) were observed in the most polluted and eutrophic waters of the bay in spring (Pico-E: P/G1). Black River inflow to the bay was hypothesized to be among the mechanisms maintaining this pronounced and long-term imbalance in the open system without any negative consequences for the picophytoplankton assemblages.

"Advances in medical treatment for gastric ulcer (GU) and duodenal ulcer (DU) have lead to an increase in the number of cases where surgical interventions implied resection and vagotomy. A classic or laparoscopic approach is required by perforated DU, diagnosis responsible for the high percentage of deaths. In this case it is excluded the conservative treatment with proton pump inhibitors and the eradication of the infection with Helicobacter pylori (HP). Our study presents observations on the treatment of postoperative DU on a group of elderly patients (>60 years) with associated chronic diseases. The studied group includes patients hospitalized between 2005 - 2010 in the Department of Surgery, in Sf. Pantelimon, Sf. loan, and Coltea Hospitals. Of 186 emergency presentations, 23 were duodenal ulcer relapse, 126 perforated DU and GU 37 were cases of perforated GU. 15-16% were aged >60 years, mainly males. For cases of duodenal ulcer recurrence in the first aggressive manifestation or recurrent duodenal ulcer, treatment was instituted along with the terapeutical association regarding the type of diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, cirrhosis. For this situation, as for the treatment after surgery we considered national and international guidelines, as the consensus in 1996 in Maastricht ""European concept in the management of Helicobacter pilory infection"" and the 1997 U.S. ""American Digestive Health Foundation.""

"although the tendency towards a Semantic Web is increasing, the current Web is keen on more semantic data. There are several web application domains which need to present their data in the form of graphs to get information and knowledge to allow semantic web searching to deal with them. These domains can be for example geographic data, data in the area of bioinformatics, social networks or even corporate search engines. Most of these domains already store their data in relational database management systems which are not capable of being queried directly by semantic web applications. In this paper we will propose a semi-automated method to map the data from relational databases to RDF structures. This is true for both a single source database as well as different source databases. The results show a complexity of order n(2) where n is the number of records processed, when it comes to the performance in creating the output from mapping the relational database to RDF files.

The sensitivity of proposed force sensor in terms of wavelength-shift is 33 nm/nN and the limit of detection is 1.6 x 10 (2) nN.

"Analytical solutions of partial differential equation (PDE) models describing reactive transport phenomena in saturated porous media are often used as screening tools to provide insight into contaminant fate and transport processes. While many practical modelling scenarios involve spatially variable coefficients, such as spatially variable flow velocity, v(x), or spatially variable decay rate, k(x), most analytical models deal with constant coefficients. Here we present a framework for constructing exact solutions of PDE models of reactive transport. Our approach is relevant for advection-dominant problems, and is based on a regular perturbation technique. We present a description of the solution technique for a range of one-dimensional scenarios involving constant and variable coefficients, and we show that the solutions compare well with numerical approximations. Our general approach applies to a range of initial conditions and various forms of v(x) and k(x). Instead of simply documenting specific solutions for particular cases, we present a symbolic worksheet, as supplementary material, which enables the solution to be evaluated for different choices of the initial condition, v(x) and k(x). We also discuss how the technique generalizes to apply to models of coupled multispecies reactive transport as well as higher dimensional problems.

"A secure and safe authentication on a vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) is essential for network security. A safe data transmission requires integrity, availability and privacy protection features as well as efficient communication in diverse settings. Recently proposed security protocols for vehicular communication cannot authenticate in a complex way in areas of heavy traffic due to the increasing number of messages in proportion to the number of vehicles. For efficient communication, data volume need be reduced and communication should be safe against a range of attacks. Hence, the present paper proposes a protocol that accelerates message processing by sending a low data volume for communication in areas of heavy traffic and that blocks replay attacks by checking timestamps. In addition, CASPER/FDR (Lowe in Casper: a compiler for the analysis of security protocols. User Manual and Tutorial, Version 1.12, 2009; Formal Systems (Europe) Ltd in Failures-Divergence Renement.

"A new fast computational structure identical both for the forward and backward modified discrete cosine/sine transform (MDCT/MDST) computation is described. It is the result of a systematic construction of a fast algorithm for an efficient implementation of the complete time domain aliasing cancellation (TDAC) analysis/synthesis MDCT/MDST filter banks. It is shown that the same computational structure can be used both for the encoder and the decoder, thus significantly reducing design time and resources. The corresponding generalized signal flow graph is regular and defines new sparse matrix factorizations of the discrete cosine transform of type IV (DCT-IV) and MDCT/MDST matrices. The identical fast MDCT computational structure provides an efficient implementation of the MDCT in MPEG layer III (MP3) audio coding and the Dolby Labs AC-3 codec. All steps to derive the computational structure are described in detail, and to put them into perspective a comprehensive list of references classified into categories is provided covering new research results achieved in the time period 1999-2008 in theoretical and practical developments of TDAC analysis/synthesis MDCT/MDST filter banks (general mathematical, symmetry and special properties, fast MDCT/MDST algorithms and efficient software/hardware implementations of the MDCT in MP3).

"Adults' adaptive interactions with intimate partners enhance well-being. Here we hypothesized that adult males' physiological responses to opposite-sex conspecifics' distress result from an interaction between an environmental factor (early social interaction with caregivers) and a genetic factor (a polymorphism within the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene, 5-HTTLPR). We assessed heart rate changes in 42 non-married male adults to distress vocalizations (female, infant, and bonobo cries). Males' early interaction with parents was assessed using the Parental Bonding Instrument. Buccal mucosa cell samples were collected to assess their 5-HTTLPR genotype. A significant interaction emerged between early experience and genetic predisposition. Males with a genetic predisposition for higher sensitivity to environmental factors showed atypical physiological responses to adult female cries according to their experienced early maternal parenting. Environmental experiences and genetic characteristics are associated with adult males' physiological responses to socially meaningfully stimuli. Understanding the mechanisms that modulate responses to opposite-sex conspecifics may improve personal well-being and social adaptiveness.

"A central idea in distance-based machine learning algorithms such k-nearest neighbors and manifold learning is to choose a set of references, or a neighborhood, based on a distance functions to represent the local structure around a query point and use the local structures as the basis to construct models. Local Partial Least Square (local PLS), which is the result of applying this neighborhood based idea in Partial Least Square (PLS), has been shown to perform very well on the regression of small-sample sized and multicollinearity data, but seldom used in high-dimensionality classification. Furthermore the difference between PLS and local PLS with respect to their optimal intrinsic dimensions is unclear. In this paper we combine local PLS with non-Euclidean distance in order to find out which measures are better suited for high dimensionality classification. Experimental results obtained on 8 UCI and spectroscopy datasets show that the Euclidean distance is not a good distance fiinction for use in local PLS classification, especially in high dimensionality cases; instead Manhattan distance and fractional distance are preferred. Experimental results further show that the optimal intrinsic dimension of local PLS is smaller than that of the standard PLS.

"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulate as a result of high concentrations of reactive aldehydes, oxidative stress, and insufficient degradation of glycated proteins. AGEs are therefore accepted biomarkers for aging, diabetes, and several degenerative diseases. Due to the Warburg effect and increased oxidative stress, cancer cells frequently accumulate significant amounts of AGEs. As the accumulation of AGEs may reflect the metabolic state and receptor signaling, we evaluated the potential prognostic and predictive value of this biomarker. We used immunohistochemistry to determine the AGE N epsilon-carboxymethyl lysine (CML) in 213 mammary carcinoma samples and Western blotting to detect AGEs in cell cultures. Whereas no significant correlation between hormone receptor status and CML was observed in cell lines, CML accumulation in tumors was positively correlated with the presence of estrogen receptor alpha, the postmenopausal state, and age. A negative correlation was found for grade III carcinomas and triple-negative cases. In a retrospective Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, there was a statistical trend that high CML accumulation correlated with a more favorable prognosis (relapse-free survival, RFS) under tamoxifen treatment (p = 0.1). In estrogen receptor-negative cases, the high CML content was significantly correlated with an unfavorable outcome (RFS) of chemotherapy (p = 0.046). CML is a therefore a potentially predictive marker for the treatment of breast cancer patients with tamoxifen or chemotherapy.

"A computer vision-based autonomous fire suppression system with real-time feedback of fire size and spray direction is presented in this paper. The system has been developed for use in a firefighting robot for close-range, localized fire suppression tasks in enclosed environments. A probabilistic water classification method was developed for segmenting water spray in a pair of IR cameras. Stereo processing was performed to localize points along the spray path for use in yaw and pitch angle estimation. A Golden Section Search with linear least squares optimization was used to determine the optimal pitch angle of the spray position at each sampling time. Kalman filtering was used to remove noise from the angle measurements and obtain a better estimate of the current nozzle orientation. A decision tree was used to determine the correct nozzle positioning mode using image feedback to suppress the fire and accounts for errors in direction, fire size during suppression, and when to adjust the nozzle based on IR feedback. Through implementation of a PI controller, the system is able to correct for unknown disturbances causing erroneous targeting of a localized fire. Experiments are presented with the initial nozzle angled correctly and with forced offsets in the system to set the initial spray position incorrectly in order for the system to correct. Suppression times ranged from 7.2 s to 16.3 s with a standard deviation of 3.9 s and average time of 11.2 s. A total of 12 tests demonstrated performance of the system given a forced offset to the initial nozzle orientation resulting in an error between the spray location and the fire target. Suppression times ranged from 8.1 s to 27.9 s with a mean of 16.9 s and standard deviation of 6.2 s. The proposed system can be implemented on a robotic firefighting platform to autonomously detect a fire, choose a proper manipulation goal and suppress full scale fires given disturbances causing erroneous targeting.

"A generalized state space representation of dynamical systems with random modes switching according to a white random process is presented. The new formulation includes a term, in the dynamics equation, that depends on the most recent linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimate of the state. This can model the behavior of a feedback control system featuring a state estimator. The measurement equation is allowed to depend on the previous LMMSE estimate of the state, which can represent the fact that measurements are obtained from a validation window centered about the predicted measurement and not from the entire surveillance region. The LMMSE filter is derived for the considered problem. The approach is demonstrated in the context of target tracking in clutter and is shown to be competitive with several popular nonlinear methods.

"As a result of the loss of financial resources and the need to optimize projects, academics, politicians, and the construction industry have become increasingly aware of the challenges presented by the frequent time and cost overruns and reduced quality of construction projects. The purpose of this study was to analyze the factors that project managers experience as having the greatest effect on time, cost, and quality, and to discover whether the effects of these factors are significantly different from each other. A questionnaire with 26 factors identified from interviews was sent to the full population of publicly employed project managers. Factors were ranked using the relative importance index and tested for significant differences using Friedman's test. Wilcoxon's test was used in a post-hoc analysis. From the findings it was determined that the most influential factor for time is unsettled or lack of project funding; for cost, errors or omissions in consultant material; and for quality, errors or omissions in construction work. The main conclusion of this research is that project schedule, budget, and quality level are affected in significantly different ways. Therefore, a project manager cannot handle such critical issues by focusing only on schedule or budget complications; nor can he or she assume that time, cost, and quality are equally affected.

"A recent electrophysiological study suggests existing compensatory brain activity as a mechanism for functional recovery of visual attention detection (the capacity for detecting external cues) in symptomatically remitted schizophrenia patients. Despite such evidence, little is known about other aspects of attentional-related processes in schizophrenia during clinical remission, such as their capacity to concentrate on the task at hands without being interfered by distracting information. To this end, we recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) from 20 symptomatically remitted schizophrenia patients and 20 healthy controls while they engaged in a classic Stroop task. Symptomatically remitted patients showed comparable Stroop interference to healthy controls, indicating a degree of functional recovery of such a capacity in these patients. On the neural level, the N450 over the fronto-central and central regions, a component of the ERPs related to conflict detection, was found across both groups, although patients presented a reduced N450 relative to healthy controls. By contrast, the amplitude of the sustained potential (SP) (600-800 ms) over the parieto-central and parietal regions, a component of the ERPs related to conflict resolution, was significantly increased in patients relative to healthy controls. Furthermore, such increased SP amplitude correlated positively with improved behavioral accuracy in symptomatically remitted patients with schizophrenia. These findings reveal that symptomatically remitted patients with schizophrenia increasingly recruited the parietal activity involving successful conflict resolution to offset reduced conflict detection. Therefore, this provides further insight into compensatory mechanisms potentially involving a degree of functional recovery of attentional-related processes in schizophrenia during clinical remission.

The following investigation documents the deflection of towers and the deck during the vehicle's passage, as well as the change in cable tensions. This was achieved by studying monitored data from the bridge collected by accelerometers and strain gauges attached to the stay cables, as well as two robotic total stations that measured the deflection of the mid-span and the sway of the tower saddle. These results were subsequently compared to the response predicted by a finite element (FE) model of the bridge, indicating an accurate match.

"A Summary This manuscript describes the role of low vitamin D in bone metabolism of Klinefelter subjects. Low vitamin D is frequent in this condition and seems to be more important than testosterone in inducing low bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis. Supplementation with vitamin D restores BMD after 2 years of treatment, whereas testosterone alone seems to be ineffective. Introduction Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) in Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is frequent, and it has been traditionally related to low testosterone (T) levels. However, low BMD can be observed also in patients with normal T levels and T replacement therapy does not necessarily increase bone mass in these patients. Nothing is known about vitamin D levels and supplementation in KS. In this study, we determine vitamin D status and bone mass in KS subjects and compare the efficacy of T therapy and vitamin D supplementation on BMD. Methods A total of 127 non-mosaic KS patients and 60 age-matched male controls were evaluated with reproductive hormones, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, PTH, and bone densitometry by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Patients with hypogonadism and/or 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency were treated with T-gel 2 % and/or calcifediol and re-evaluated after 24 months of treatment. Results 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were significantly lower in KS patients with respect to controls, and they had significantly lower lumbar and femoral BMD. The percentage of osteopenia/osteoporosis in subjects with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency was higher with respect to subjects with normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D and was not related to the presence/absence of low T levels. Subjects treated with calcifediol or T + calcifediol had a significant increase in lumbar BMD after treatment. No difference was found in T-treated group. Conclusion These data highlight that low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels seem to have a more critical role than low T levels in inducing low BMD in KS subjects. Furthermore, vitamin D supplementation seems to be more effective than T replacement therapy alone in increasing BMD.

"Accumulating evidence indicates that a small subset of cancer cells, termed the tumor-initiating cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs), construct a reservoir of self-sustaining cancer cells with the characteristic ability to self-renew and maintain the tumor mass. The CSCs play an important role in the tumor initiation, development, relapse, metastasis, and the ineffectiveness of conventional cancer therapies. CD47 is a ligand for signal-regulatory protein-alpha expressed on phagocytic cells and functions to inhibit phagocytosis. This study was to explore if the expression of CD47 is the mechanism used by lung cancer cells, especially CSCs, to escape phagocytosis in vitro and in vivo. Here, we selected CD133 as the marker for lung CSCs according to previous reports. We analyzed lung cancer and matched adjacent normal (non-tumor) tissue and revealed that CD47 is overexpressed on lung cancer cells, especially on lung CSCs. The mRNA expression levels of CD47 and CD133 correlated with a decreased probability of survival for multiple types of lung cancer. Blocking CD47 function with anti-CD47 antibodies enabled macrophage phagocytosis of lung cancer cells and lung CSCs. Anti-CD47 antibodies inhibited tumor growth in immunodeficient mouse xenotransplantation models established with lung cancer cells or lung CSCs and improved survival in tumor-bearing animals. These data indicate that CD47 is a valid target for cancer therapies, especially for anti-CSC therapies.

"An attack graph depicts multiple-step attack and provides a description of system security vulnerabilities. It illustrates critical information necessary to identify potential weaknesses and areas for enhanced defense. Attack graphs include multiple attack paths, which are a focus for further detailed analysis and risk mitigation. Considering that different vulnerabilities have different probabilities of being exploited, this paper proposes an algorithm to dynamically generate the top K attack paths with maximum probabilities for every node of a system. The proposed algorithm does not require generation of the full attack graph to calculate the K attack paths. Instead, it directly processes and analyzes the system input data and dynamically identifies the K attack paths. The computational time, based upon the complexity of the attack paths, can be constrained by the parameter K. Experimental results show that the algorithm is scalable and efficient.

"A high-resolution drought forecast model for ungauged areas was developed in this study. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) with 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month time scales were forecasted with 1-6-month lead times at 0.05 x 0.05 degrees resolution. The use of long-range climate forecast data was compared to the use of climatological data for periods with no observation data. Machine learning models utilizing drought-related variables based on remote sensing data were compared to the spatial interpolation of Kriging. Two performance measures were used; one is producer's drought accuracy, defined as the number of correctly classified samples in extreme, severe, and moderate drought classes over the total number of samples in those classes, and the other is user's drought accuracy, defined as the number of correctly classified samples in drought classes over the total number of samples classified to those classes. One of the machine learning models, extremely randomized trees, performed the best in most cases in terms of producer's accuracy reaching up to 64%, while spatial interpolation performed better in terms of user's accuracy up to 44%. The contribution of long-range climate forecast data was not significant under the conditions used in this study, but further improvement is expected if forecast skill is improved or a more sophisticated downscaling method is used. Simulated decreases of forecast error in precipitation and mean temperature were tested: the simulated decrease of forecast error in precipitation improves drought forecast while the decrease of forecast error in mean temperature does not contribute much. Although there is still some room for improvement, the developed model can be used for drought-related decision making in ungauged areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Acute kidney injury (AKI) leads to chronic kidney disease. The mechanisms involved with recovery from AKI are poorly understood and molecular mediators responsible for healing and restoration of kidney function are understudied. We previously discovered differential expression of matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) mRNA and protein in patients with severe sepsis associated AKI versus sepsis without AKI. Here, we demonstrate the involvement of MMP-8 in purely ischemic AKI. Mice subjected to 30 min of bilateral renal ischemia developed increased plasma creatinine and MMP-8 expression within 24 h versus sham controls. After an initial surge and subsequent return toward baseline, both kidney MMP-8 expression and activity exhibited a late increase (Days 5-7 post-ischemia reperfusion) in mice subjected to AKI. Neutrophil infiltration of the kidney was significantly higher after AKI in wild-type mice than in MMP-8 null mice, starting at 4 days. Additionally, MMP-8 null mice subjected to AKI demonstrated a persistent histopathologic and functional injury and worsened health (greater overall weight loss) versus wild-type cohorts after seven days. Taken together, our findings suggest that MMP-8 is involved with restoration of baseline kidney health after ischemic kidney injury and that a potential mechanism involves the interaction of MMP-8 and neutrophil recruitment to the site of injury.

The polarization P and magnetization M defined as P = D-epsilon(0) E, M = B-mu(0) H are given explicit expressions in terms of microscopic electromagnetic structure of the matter. Lorentz transformation of space-time and electromagnetic field can be derived entirely within the framework of electromagnetic theory.

"Advanced jet engines do not operate in an application vacuum. Their optimal use in advanced military applications drives much of their basic innovative research and development, especially when new needs arise in the rapidly changing domains of stealth-agile, fighter aircraft and tailless-stealth, Jet-Steered, Unmanned Air Vehicles (JS-UAV). For these reasons we periodically update this Journal with new trends that affect, and sometimes control, research and development of future jet-engines. One relevant example is the recently unmasked RQ-180 stealth-tailless drone, which is an improved version of the smaller, RQ-170 captured by Iran. Most important, with the new X-47B/C tailless-stealth JS-UAV, it is to dominate future uses of fuel-efficient jet-engines, especially for operating in dusty environments. The RQ-180 has been secretly designed and funded since 2008. It is based on a classified, 1986, parent Israeli Patents 78402, which protect hundreds design and testing trade secrets taken from 1986 to 1997 by the United States Government (USG) via classified contracts with USG-Contractors Boeing, Lockheed, General Dynamics and General Electric, as revealed by a December 6, 2013 Aviation Week [1-3] and U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, Case 2014-5028, Docket 12 [4]. The new RQ-180 design explains the recent U. S. Air Force ISR shift away from ""permissive"" environments - such as Iraq and Afghanistan, where non-stealthy Global Hawk and General Atomics' Reaper operate - toward new missions in highly ""contested"" or strongly ""denied"" enemy airspaces.

"A real-time cooperative communication based wireless network is presented for monitoring health and activity of an end-user in their environment. The cooperative communication offers better energy consumption and also an opportunity to aware the current location of a user non-intrusively. The link between mobile sensor node and relay node is dynamically established by using Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Link Quality Indicator (LQI) based on adaptive relay selection scheme. The study proposes a Linear Acceleration based Transmission Power Decision Control (LA-TPDC) algorithm to further enhance the energy efficiency of cooperative communication. Further, the occurrences of false alarms are carefully prevented by introducing three stages of sequential warning system. The real-time experiments are carried-out by using the nodes, namely mobile sensor node, relay nodes and a destination node which are indigenously developed by using a CC430 microcontroller integrated with an in-built transceiver at 868 MHz. The wireless node performance characteristics, such as energy consumption, SignalNoise ratio (SNR), Bit Error Rate (BER), Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and transmission offset are evaluated for all the participated nodes. The experimental results observed that the proposed linear acceleration based transmission power decision control algorithm almost doubles the battery life time than energy efficient conventional cooperative communication.

"A new, small and efficient voltage regulator, realized using a resonant switched-capacitor converter technology, is introduced. Voltage regulation is implemented by means of simple digital pulse density modulation. It displays an ideal transient response with a zero-order nature to all disturbance types. The newly developed topology acts as a gyrator with awide range of voltage conversion ratios (below as well as above unity) with constant efficiency characteristics for the entire operation range. The operation of the voltage regulator is verified on a 20 W experimental prototype, demonstrating ideal transient recovery without over/undershoots in response to load and line transients. Simple design guidelines for the voltage regulation system are provided and verified by experiments.

"A long-standing belief is that sign language interferes with spoken language development in deaf children, despite a chronic lack of evidence supporting this belief. This deserves discussion as poor life outcomes continue to be seen in the deaf population. This commentary synthesizes research outcomes with signing and non-signing children and highlights fully accessible language as a protective factor for healthy development. Brain changes associated with language deprivation may be misrepresented as sign language interfering with spoken language outcomes of cochlear implants. This may lead to professionals and organizations advocating for preventing sign language exposure before implantation and spreading misinformation. The existence of one-time-sensitive-language acquisition window means a strong possibility of permanent brain changes when spoken language is not fully accessible to the deaf child and sign language exposure is delayed, as is often standard practice. There is no empirical evidence for the harm of sign language exposure but there is some evidence for its benefits, and there is growing evidence that lack of language access has negative implications. This includes cognitive delays, mental health difficulties, lower quality of life, higher trauma, and limited health literacy. Claims of cochlear implant- and spoken language-only approaches being more effective than sign language-inclusive approaches are not empirically supported. Cochlear implants are an unreliable standalone first-language intervention for deaf children. Priorities of deaf child development should focus on healthy growth of all developmental domains through a fully-accessible first language foundation such as sign language, rather than auditory deprivation and speech skills.

"A heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system is a multi-variable strongly coupled large-scale system that is composed of several sub-systems. Considerable research, simulations, and experiments have been conducted on HVAC control. The optimization control of an HVAC system is now the popular issue. The ultimate goal of this paper was to achieve minimum energy consumption and improve system efficiency. Multi-zone variable air volume and variable water volume air-conditioning systems were developed. The dynamic models of HVAC sub-systems were built by the adaptive directional forgetting method. Control strategies such as the gearshift integral proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller and self-tuning PID controller were studied in the platform to improve the dynamic characteristics of the HVAC system. System performance was improved. The system saved 18.2% of energy with the integration of iterative learning control and sequential quadratic programming based on the steady-state hierarchical optimization control scheme.

"Age-associated changes in cardiac structure and function, together with estrogen loss, contribute to the progression of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in older women. To investigate the effects of aging and estrogen loss on the development of its precursor, asymptomatic left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, echocardiograms were performed in 10 middle-aged (20 months) and 30 old-aged (30 months) female Fischer344xBrown-Norway rats, 4 and 8 weeks after ovariectomy (OVX) and sham procedures (gonads left intact). The cardioprotective potential of administering chronic G1, the selective agonist to the new G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), was further evaluated in old rats (Old-OVX+G1) versus age-matched, vehicle-treated OVX and gonadal intact rats. Advanced age and estrogen loss led to decreases in myocardial relaxation and elevations in filling pressure, in part, due to reductions in phosphorylated phospholamban and increases in cardiac collagen deposition. Eight weeks of G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor activation in Old-OVX+G1 rats reversed the adverse effects of age and estrogen loss on myocardial relaxation through increases in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase expression and reductions in interstitial fibrosis. These findings may explain the preponderance of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in older postmenopausal women and provide a promising, late-life therapeutic target to reverse or halt the progression of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.

"A chitin-based polyurethane (TRCPU) organogel composed of isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), polyethylene glycol (PEG) and chitin is shown to undergo a temperature-dependent sal-to-gel transition in polar organic solvents. The soft segments of the prepolymer that originated from the PEG imparted elastomeric and hydrophilic characteristics to the TRCPUs. The hard segments of chitin and IPDI that contained highly polar urethane linkages acted as physical alignment sites and provided lipophilic characteristics for the TRCPUs in the polar organic solvent. The average molecular weight and the degree of acetylation of chitin were determined based on the intrinsic viscosity and solid-state C-13-CP/MAS NMR spectrum. Chitin was incorporated into polyurethane via covalent bonding; the resultant copolymer was an injectable organosol at low temperatures that transformed to a semisolid organogel at approximately 105 degrees C. The TRCPUs were characterized by H-1 NMR, FT-IR and DSC, and the theological behavior of the TRCPU solutions in organic solvents was studied. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Adaptive and intelligent instructional systems are used to deal with the issue of learning personalisation in contexts where human instructors are not immediately available, so their role is transferred entirely or in part onto the computer. Even though such systems are mostly developed for well-defined domains that have a rather straightforward acquisition order, such as mathematics or computer programming, they found their application in ill-defined domains as well. Natural language learning is one such domain, and developing adaptive instructional systems for this specific purpose is notoriously complex and challenging due to the nature of language systems. The paper at hand examines the theoretical background of adaptivity and intelligence in instructional systems, and discusses their application in learning and teaching of natural languages. Moreover, the paper reviews adaptive and intelligent language learning systems in existence and identifies their characteristics in a systematic manner. The discussion section offers a more detailed view of selected systems for language learning that exhibit interesting and innovative implementation solutions. The paper concludes by suggesting possible developmental directions and future work in the field.

"Aim: The campos rupestres are species-rich tropical mountain grasslands in southeast Brazil that are threatened by mining and quarrying. Eight years following a strong disturbance (i.e. quarrying for gravel exploitation during the asphalting of highway MG-010), spontaneous succession did not occur on degraded areas. This study was therefore designed to test the restoration technique of hay transfer as a means of enhancing seed dispersal from the reference ecosystems to the degraded areas. Location: Campo rupestre grasslands, Serra do Cipo, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Methods: Nine degraded areas representing three kinds of substrate (latosol, sandy and stony) were selected. Hay transfer was carried out using hay collected in two kinds of grassland (i.e. campos arenosos and campos pedregosos) year-round in 2010, in order to maximize the seed pool. The collected hay was distributed on 40 cm x 40 cm quadrats among the three types of substrate, with and without geotextile, according to the following protocol: hay from campo arenoso grasslands was spread on all types of substrate, while hay from campo pedregoso grasslands was used on stony substrate only. Results: Few seedlings emerged within 14 mo of the treatment application, despite the large number of seeds contained in the hay, indicating that hay transfer may not be a useful method for restoring degraded areas of campos rupestres. The seedlings emerging on the degraded areas mainly belonged to ruderal species. Therefore, we suggest that, although poor soil conditions could limit seedling establishment, germination issues of the campo rupestre species are the first limitation for restoring degraded campos rupestres using hay transfer. Conclusion: Our results highlight the inherent difficulty in restoring degraded areas of campos rupestres; their protection must be made a high conservation priority.

"A water and an acetone extract of the Icelandic brown algae Fucus vesiculosus were evaluated as potential natural sources of antioxidant compounds in skin care emulsions. To assess their efficacy in inhibiting lipid oxidation caused by photo- or thermoxidation, they were stored in darkness and room temperature as control conditions, and compared to samples stored under accelerated conditions (light and room temperature, or darkness and 40 degrees C). The presence of extracts in the skin care emulsions induced remarkable colour changes when the emulsions were exposed to light, and more extensively under high temperature. High temperature also caused greater increments in the droplet size of the emulsions. The analysis of the tocopherol content, peroxide value and volatile compounds during the storage revealed that, whereas both water and acetone extracts showed (at 2mg/g of emulsion) protective effect against thermooxidation, only the water extract showed antioxidant activity against photooxidation. Practical applications: This research is the basis of developing natural antioxidants derived from seaweed to limit lipid oxidation in skin care products.

They might allow them the possibility of living at home for longer whilst maintaining their comfort and security as well as offering a way towards reducing the huge economic and personal costs forecast as the incidence of dementia increases worldwide over coming decades. However, the development, introduction and use of AAL technologies also trigger serious ethical issues. This paper is a systematic literature review of the on-going scholarly debate about these issues. More specifically, we look at the ethical issues involved in research and development, clinical experimentation, and clinical application of AAL technologies for people with dementia and related stakeholders. In the discussion we focus on: (1) the value of the goals of AAL technologies, (2) the special vulnerability of persons with dementia in their private homes, (3) the complex question of informed consent for the usage of AAL technologies.

"Achievement and maintenance of virologic suppression after cancer diagnosis have been associated with improved outcomes in HIV-infected patients, but few studies have analyzed the virologic and immunologic outcomes after a cancer diagnosis. All HIV-infected patients with a diagnosis of cancer between 2000 and 2011 in an urban clinic population in Baltimore, MD, were included for review. HIV-related outcomes (HIV-1 RNA viral load and CD4 cell count) were abstracted and compared for patients with non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs) and AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs). Four hundred twelve patients with baseline CD4 or HIV-1 RNA viral load data were analyzed. There were 122 (30%) diagnoses of ADCs and 290 (70%) NADCs. Patients with NADCs had a higher median age (54 years vs. 43 years, p < .0001) and a higher frequency of hepatitis C coinfection (52% vs. 36%, p = .002). The median baseline CD4 was lower for patients with ADCs (137 cells/mm 3 vs. 314 cells/mm 3) and patients with NADCs were more likely to be suppressed at cancer diagnosis (59% vs. 25%) (both p < .0001). The median CD4 for patients with NADCs was significantly higher than patients with ADCs at 6 and 12 months after diagnosis and higher at 18 and 24 months, but not significantly. Patients with an NADC had 2.19 times (95% CI 1.04-4.62) the adjusted odds of being suppressed at 12 months and 2.17 times the odds (95% CI 0.92-5.16) at 24 months compared to patients with an ADC diagnosis. For patients diagnosed with ADCs and NADCs in this urban clinic setting, both virologic suppression and immunologic recovery improved over time. Patients with NADCs had the highest odds of virologic suppression in the 2 years following cancer diagnosis.

"Abnormalities of T cell-mediated immune activation, in the absence of active somatic immune diseases, have consistently been reported in mood disorders. Apart from being important players in the regulation of cells of the immune system, T cells are essential for normal brain development. We here report studies on the relationship between circulating levels of T helper cells and structural and functional brain imaging in depressed bipolar patients. Since the CCL20-CCR6 axis is an important entry to the brain we differentiated the various T helper cell subpopulations on the basis of their chemokine receptor expression. Methods: FACS staining was performed for Th1,Th2,Th17, Th22 and T regulatory cells on frozen leukocytes of 25 consecutively admitted inpatients affected by a major depressive episode, without psychotic features, in the course of Bipolar Disorder I and 21 healthy controls. The frequency of the T helper populations was associated with DTI and fMRI data acquired on a Philips 3.0 Tesla scanner. Tract based spatial statistic was used to obtain measures of white matter integrity (fractional anisotropy, axial, radial and mean diffusivity) from a standard DTI sequence with 35 directions. Patients were also studied for fMRI through a moral valence decision task were subjects had to decide whether morally tuned stimuli were positive or negative. Results: The percentage of circulating Th17 (CCR6(+)CXCR3(neg)CCR4(+)CCR10(neg)) cells correlated positively with higher fractional anisotropy in fiber tracts contributing to the functional integrity of the brain both in patients and healthy controls, while the frequency of circulating T regulatory (CD(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+)) cells correlated positively with higher radial and mean diffusivity in patients. The frequency of circulating T regulatory cells also correlated to lower neuronal responses to negative versus positive morally tuned stimuli in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of patients. Thl cells correlated negatively with white matter integrity in several tracts (healthy controls), while the cells showed a positive correlation to the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (patients). Conclusion: This study shows a new putative role for Th17 cells. Th17 cells are not only playing a role in inducing autoimmunity and auto-inflammation, but might also play a counter intuitive anabolic role in the maintenance of the functional and structural integrity of the brain.

"[Purpose] The aim of this study was to analyze stabilometry in athletes during an indoor season in order to determine whether injured athletes show different stabilometric values before injury than non-injured athletes in two different training periods (volume and pre-competition periods). [Subjects] The subjects were 51 athletes from Unicaja athletic club who trained regularly. [Methods] At the end of the preseason and volume periods, athletes were subjected to bipodal and monopodal stabilometry. In addition, all injuries happening in the periods after performing stabilometry (volume and pre-competition periods) were tracked. [Results] Variance analysis of bipodal stabilometric measurements taken at the end of the preseason period showed that athletes with higher values for the center-of-pressure spread variables suffered injuries during the volume period. The right-leg monopodal stabilometric measurements taken at the end of the volume period showed that athletes with higher values in the center-of-pressure position variables suffered injuries during the pre-competition period. [Conclusion] Athletes showing the worst values for center-of-pressure spread variables are more prone to sports injuries in the subsequent training period. In monopodal measurements, athletes with poorer mediolateral stability were more prone to injuries in the subsequent training period.

"A systematic review of rugby union and league injuries among players under the age of 21 years was carried out to calculate probabilities of match injury for a player over a season and a pooled estimate of match injury incidence where studies were sufficiently similar. The probability of a player being injured over a season ranged from 6% to 90% for rugby union and 68% to 96% for rugby league. The pooled injury incidence estimate for rugby union was 26.7/1000 player-hours for injuries irrespective of need for medical attention or time-loss and 10.3/1000 player-hours for injuries requiring at least 7 days absence from games; equivalent to a 28.4% and 12.1% risk of being injured over a season. Study heterogeneity contributed to a wide variation in injury incidence. Public injury surveillance and prevention systems have been successful in reducing injury rates in other countries.

"A highly integrated Ku-band (10.7-12.75 GHz) planar phased array receiver of 64 antenna elements is presented. It features instantaneous reception of the full Ku-band (2.05 GHz wide) in two orthogonal polarizations with wide scan angles by using time delay instead of phase shift. The receiver is part of a system for satellite broadcast TV reception on board of moving vehicles. Two SiGe radio frequency integrated circuits (RFICs) were developed, packaged in ceramic BGAs and assembled onto a 15-layer printed circuit board (PCB) which integrates the antenna elements. An outline of the system is given along with a detailed description. It sets a new standard in integration density. The receiver has extensive analog signal processing at intermediate frequency (IF)-level. A novel bipolar implementation for true time delay is proposed, with a continuous programmable delay range of 0...80 ps with less than 2.5 ps group-delay variation in 2 GHz bandwidth (BW). The wide BW calls for a constant group-delay implementation in the IF chain. The receiver (RFIC) consumes only 132 mW per channel. Each channel has 40 dB gain.

"Aging is associated with metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Aging contributes to common processes including metabolic dysfunction, DNA damage, and reactive oxygen species generation. Although glycolysis has been linked to cell growth and proliferation, the mechanisms by which the activation of glycolysis by aging regulates fibrogenesis in the lung remain unclear. The objective of this study was to determine if glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1)-induced glycolysis regulates age-dependent fibrogenesis of the lung. Mouse and human lung tissues were analyzed for GLUT1 and glycolytic markers using immunoblotting. Glycolytic function was measured using a Seahorse apparatus. To study the effect of GLUT1, genetic inhibition of GLUT1 was performed by short hairpin RNA transduction, and phloretin was used for pharmacologic inhibition of GLUT1. GLUT1-dependent glycolysis is activated in aged lung. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of GLUT1 suppressed the protein expression of a-smooth muscle actin, a key cytoskeletal component of activated fibroblasts, in mouse primary lung fibroblast cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that the activation of AMP activated protein kinase, which is regulated by GLUT1-dependent glycolysis, represents a critical metabolic pathway for fibroblast activation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that phloretin, a potent inhibitor of GLUT1, significantly inhibited bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in vivo. These results suggest that GLUT1-dependent glycolysis regulates fibrogenesis in aged lung and that inhibition of GLUT1 provides a potential target of therapy of age-related lung fibrosis.

"A more profound investigation about the responses in activity levels following pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in patients with COPD is needed. We aimed to describe groups of patients with COPD according to patterns of change in physical activity and sedentary behaviour following PR. 90 patients with COPD (60% male; mean age 67 +/- 8; median FEV1 47 (32-62) % pred) completed a comprehensive PR programme. A triaxial accelerometer was used to assess the time in sedentary behaviour, light activities and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Additionally, exercise capacity, quality of life, and symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed before and after PR. Six groups with different patterns of change in physical activity and sedentary behaviour were identified. The two most prevalent patterns were represented by good responders (increase in physical activity and reduction in sedentary behaviour, 34%) and poor responders (decrease in physical activity and increase in sedentary behaviour, 30%). Good responders had greater improvements in six-minute walk distance (6MWD) and symptoms of depression than poor responders (P < 0.05 for all). Strong correlation was found between changes in sedentary behaviour and changes in light activities (r(s) = -0.89; P < 0.0001). Changes in 6MWD correlated fairly with changes in sedentary behaviour (r(s) = -0.26), light activities (r(s) = 0.25), and MVPA (r(s) = 0.24); P < 0.05 for all. Different patterns of change in activity levels following PR can be found in patients with COPD. Focusing on light physical activities might be a potential strategy to make patients less sedentary, but for this to be achieved prior (or at least parallel) improvements in functional capacity seem to be necessary.

"An ad hoc wireless network is a set of nodes connected by wireless links in which nodes cooperate to forward packets from a source to a destination. Geographic routing (or position-based routing) has become an attractive solution for such networks since it reduces routing control overhead flooded in the network to construct routes (routes discovery). Many geographic routing protocols have been designed to guarantee packet delivery in such networks. However, these protocols consider that all nodes in the network are trustworthy which allows malicious nodes to violate network security and disrupt packet forwarding. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a new security approach that secures geographic routing protocols against a variety of attacks. Our approach is based on the use of MACs to allow intermediate nodes to verify the authenticity and the integrity of forwarded packets and uses authenticated acknowledgements to prevent packet dropping attacks. To meet node's resource constraints, we have based our solution on symmetric cryptography. Our solution is robust against modification and dropping attacks even in the presence of compromised nodes in the network.

The upgraded system with the hierarchical modulation is backward compatible in the sense that receivers that have been deployed in the original system can continue receiving data in the basic constellation. New receivers can be designed to receive data carried in the secondary constellation, as well as those in the basic constellation. Analysis will be performed to show the tradeoff between bit rate of the data in secondary constellation and the penalty to the performance of receiving the basic constellation.

"Ambient intelligence (AmI) systems are now considered a promising approach to assist people in their daily life. AmI proposes the development of context aware systems equipped with devices that can recognize your context and act accordingly. Agents provide an effective way to develop such systems since agents are reactive, proactive and exhibit an intelligent and autonomous behavior. However, current agent approaches do not adequately fulfill the requirements posed by AmI systems. From a modeling point of view, the aim should be to help in the design by providing adequate tools that assist in the development of important properties of AmI systems, such as context-awareness; and from an implementation point of view, agent technologies must be adapted to the diversity of AmI devices and communication technologies. As a solution to these issues we propose a Model driven engineering process, which supports the automatic generation of agent-based AmI systems. The source metamodel is PIM4Agents, a general purpose agent metamodel that we have adapted to support the explicit modeling of context aware systems, and the target metamodel is Malaca, an aspect-oriented agent architecture. Aspect-orientation makes Malaca platform-neutral for FIPA compliant agent platforms, simplifying the model driven process. The solution generates MalacaTiny agents, an implementation of Malaca that is able to run in AmI devices. We have evaluated the convenience of applying a model driven approach by measuring the degree of automation of our process and we have evaluated MalacaTiny for mobile phones by assessing different parameters, related to the scarcity of resources in AmI systems. All the results obtained are satisfactory.

"A high-efficiency, high-power-density buffer architecture is proposed for power pulsation decoupling in power conversion between dc and single-phase ac. We present an active decoupling solution that yields improved efficiency and reduced circuit complexity compared to existing solutions. In the proposed architecture, the main energy storage capacitor is connected in series with an active buffer converter across the dc bus. The series-stacked capacitor blocks the majority of the dc bus voltage to reduce the voltage stress on the buffer converter, such that fast, low-voltage transistors can be employed for the buffer converter. Moreover, the series capacitor provides the majority of the power pulsation decoupling through a wide voltage swing, and the buffer converter only needs to process a small fraction of the total power of the entire architecture, allowing a very small active circuit volume and very high system efficiency. The circuit operation and design constraints are analyzed in detail. In the proposed buffer architecture, the series stacking of a nearly lossless capacitor and a lossy converter presents a challenge of capacitor voltage balancing and power loss compensation. We propose a control scheme exploiting the small ripple in the bus voltage and dc input current to compensate for the power loss in the buffer converter while maintaining the voltage balance. Light-load techniques are also introduced to ensure that the buffer architecture meets strict ripple requirements while providing sufficient loss compensation. A 2-kW hardware prototype based on low-voltage GaN switches has been built to demonstrate the performance of the proposed solution. A power density of 25W/cm(3) (410 W/in(3)) by rectangular box volume and an efficiency above 98.9% across a wide load range has been experimentally verified.

"A digital dual-mode linear quadratic regulator (LQR) with feedforward optimal controller is presented, which allows voltage control of a boost converter for wide-load-range condition, whether in continuous conduction mode (CCM) or in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). Based on the conventional LQR method, the proposed controller is designed and makes the following two improvements. First, in order to eliminate the phase error caused by right-half-phase zero emerged in non-minimum phase boost converter, a feedforward controller is implemented by zero phase error tracking control technique because the inverse of non-minimum phase system is unstable. Second, since the models of DC-DC converter in CCM or DCM are different, the proposed control strategy allows boost converter to autonomously operate in CCM or DCM controller by utilising a mode detector. The proposed mode detector greatly enhances the control performance in both operating modes. Finally, the proposed controller has been implemented for voltage control of a boost converter. The simulation and experimental results show the proposed controller offers better performance in both transient response and frequency response than the conventional LQR controller.

"A Software Product Line is a set of software systems of a domain, which share some common features but also have significant variability. A feature model is a variability modeling artifact which represents differences among software products with respect to variability relationships among their features. Having a feature model along with a reference model developed in the domain engineering lifecycle, a concrete product of the family is derived by selecting features in the feature model (referred to as the configuration process) and by instantiating the reference model. However, feature model configuration can be a cumbersome task because: 1) feature models may consist of a large number of features, which are hard to comprehend and maintain; and 2) many factors including technical limitations, implementation costs, stakeholders' requirements and expectations must be considered in the configuration process. Recognizing these issues, a significant amount of research efforts has been dedicated to different aspects of feature model configuration such as automating the configuration process. Several approaches have been proposed to alleviate the feature model configuration challenges through applying visualization and interaction techniques. However, there have been limited empirical insights available into the impact of visualization and interaction techniques on the feature model configuration process. In this paper, we present a set of visualization and interaction interventions for representing and configuring feature models, which are then empirically validated to measure the impact of the proposed interventions. An empirical study was conducted by following the principles of control experiments in software engineering and by applying the well-known software quality standard ISO 9126 to operationalize the variables investigated in the experiment. The results of the empirical study revealed that the employed visualization and interaction interventions significantly improved completion time of comprehension and changing of the feature model configuration. Additionally, according to results, the proposed interventions are easy-to-use and easy-to-learn for the participants.

"A novel magnetic force driven noncontact electromagnetic-triboelectric hybrid nanogenerator for scavenging biomechanical energy to sustainably power portable electrics is presented. Based on the effective conjunction of electromagnetic induction and triboelectrification, the hybrid nanogenerator with a small dimension consists of an electromagnetic generator (EMG) with a peak output power of 3.4 mW under a load resistance of 200 Omega and a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with a peak output power of 0.23 mW under a load resistance of 25 M Omega. For TENG, the electrospun Fe3O4 nanoparticles embedded PVDF fibers membrane is employed as triboelectric layer. A magnet is utilized as the trigger to non-contactly drive contact-separation mode TENG due to the magnetic responsiveness of triboelectric materials, and the EMG can be drived by coupling magnet with copper coils simultaneously. The hybrid nanogenerator exhibits a good stability for the output performance and charging performance, so it can be utilized to charge energy storage devices and sustainably power some portable electronics. This work demonstrates a novel prototype of hybrid nanogenerators toward harvesting human biomechanical energy and its potential applications in building up self-powered systems.

"A family of conservative, truly nonlinear, oscillators with integer or non-integer order nonlinearity is considered. These oscillators have only one odd power-form elastic-term and exact expressions for their period and solution were found in terms of Gamma functions and a cosine-Ateb function, respectively. Only for a few values of the order of nonlinearity, is it possible to obtain the periodic solution in terms of more common functions. However, for this family of conservative truly nonlinear oscillators we show in this paper that it is possible to obtain the Fourier series expansion of the exact solution, even though this exact solution is unknown. The coefficients of the Fourier series expansion of the exact solution are obtained as an integral expression in which a regularized incomplete Beta function appears. These coefficients are a function of the order of nonlinearity only and are computed numerically. One application of this technique is to compare the amplitudes for the different harmonics of the solution obtained using approximate methods with the exact ones computed numerically as shown in this paper. As an example, the approximate amplitudes obtained via a modified Ritz method are compared with the exact ones computed numerically. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"An active actuator of electro-active polymer (EAP), i.e. ionic polymer metal composite (IPMC), is subjected to alternating electric potential to investigate and study the time-delayed vibration characteristics. A generalized mathematical model of the actuator is obtained assuming multi-mode excitation and applying the Hamilton's principle. Lambert W-function is then applied and a closed form solution of the transcendental characteristic equation of delay differential equation (DDE) is obtained. Delay differential equations (DDEs) are then solved taking into account the experimental data and physical properties of IPMC, and the results are discussed and validated.

"A common feature of ambient intelligence is that many objects are inter-connected and act in unison, which is also a challenge in the Internet of Things. There has been a shift in research towards integrating both concepts, considering the Internet of Things as representing the future of computing and communications. However, the efficient combination and management of heterogeneous things or devices in the ambient intelligence domain is still a tedious task, and it presents crucial challenges. Therefore, to appropriately manage the inter-connection of diverse devices in these systems requires: (1) specifying and efficiently implementing the devices (e.g., as services); (2) handling and verifying their heterogeneity and composition; and (3) standardizing and managing their data, so as to tackle large numbers of systems together, avoiding standalone applications on local servers. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a platform to manage the integration and behavior-aware orchestration of heterogeneous devices as services, stored and accessed via the cloud, with the following contributions: (i) we describe a lightweight model to specify the behavior of devices, to determine the order of the sequence of exchanged messages during the composition of devices; (ii) we define a common architecture using a service-oriented standard environment, to integrate heterogeneous devices by means of their interfaces, via a gateway, and to orchestrate them according to their behavior; (iii) we design a framework based on cloud computing technology, connecting the gateway in charge of acquiring the data from the devices with a cloud platform, to remotely access and monitor the data at run-time and react to emergency situations; and (iv) we implement and generate a novel cloud-based IoT platform of behavior-aware devices as services for ambient intelligence systems, validating the whole approach in real scenarios related to a specific ambient assisted living application.

"A nonrelational, distributed computing, data warehouse, and analytics environment (Energy-CRADLE) was developed for the analysis of field and laboratory data from multiple heterogeneous photovoltaic (PV) test sites. This data informatics and analytics infrastructure was designed to process diverse formats of PV performance data and climatic telemetry time-series data collected from a PV outdoor test network, i.e., the Solar Durability and Lifetime Extension global SunFarm network, as well as point-in-time laboratory spectral and image measurements of PV material samples. Using Hadoop/HBase for the distributed data warehouse, Energy-CRADLE does not have a predefined data table schema, which enables ingestion of data in diverse and changing formats. For easy data ingestion and data retrieval, Energy-CRADLE utilizes Hadoop streaming to enable Python MapReduce and provides a graphical user interface, i.e., py-CRADLE. By developing the Hadoop distributed computing platform and the HBase NoSQL database schema for solar energy, Energy-CRADLE exemplifies an integrated, scalable, secure, and user-friendly data informatics and analytics system for PV researchers. An example of Energy-CRADLE enabled scalable, data-driven, analytics is presented, where machine learning is used for anomaly detection across 2.2 million real-world current-voltage (I-V) curves of PV modules in three distinct Koppen-Geiger climatic zones.

"A novel duct silencer was developed using dielectric elastomer absorbers (DEAs). Dielectric elastomer, a lightweight, high elastic energy density and large deformation under high DC/AC voltages smart material, was used to fabricate this new generation actuator. The acoustic performances of this duct silencer were experimentally investigated in a transmission loss (TL) measurement system using two-load method. It was found that the resonance peaks of this new duct silencer could be controlled by applying various DC voltages, a maximum resonance shift of 59.5Hz for the resonance peaks was achieved which indicated that this duct silencer could be adjusted to absorb broadband range noise without any addition mechanical part. Furthermore, the resonance shift and multiple resonances mechanisms using DEAs were proposed and discussed in the present paper which was aiming to achieve broadband noise reduction. The present results also provide insight into the appropriateness of the absorber for possible use as new acoustic treatment to replace the traditional acoustic treatment.

A 0.6 x 0.6 m Fresnel lens was used as the primary concentrator to collect the solar light. 6.8 W continuous wave laser power was obtained from a 4 mm diameter grooved Nd:YAG rod. The output intensity was modulated with a video signal via a LiNbO3 Mach-Zehnder optoelectronic modulator. The video signal with a resolution of 1920 * 1080/frame and the frame rate of 25 Hz was transmitted over five-meter free-space in real time with high fidelity. The transmission rate was 125 Mbps and bit error rate was lower than 10(-6). This research shows the feasibility of applying a solar light directly pumped laser for free-space optical communication, which is significant for telecommunications between satellites.

"A novel method for monitoring parameters of absorbing coatings, which are widely used for stealth technology, is described in this paper. The offered method of measurements is based on the use of slow-wave structures (SWSs), which electrodynamic parameters strongly depend on the electromagnetic properties of the absorbing coatings. The main advantages of the SWS-based measurements are in the possibility to concentrate electromagnetic field in a volume with linear dimensions much smaller the wavelength in free space and to split electric and magnetic fields, providing practically independent monitoring of dielectric and magnetic properties of the coatings. Resonant frequencies and Q-factor of a SWS section placed in parallel to a monitored coating can be used as primary measuring parameters. Analysis of the dispersion equation derived for a SWS-based sensitive element in the presence of a coating allows creating algorithms for converting measured electrodynamic parameters into the reading of the coatings' electromagnetic properties. It is shown also that the use of coupled SWSs leads to the increase in the informative parameters' number and to the significant increase in sensitivity.

"All-to-all personalized exchange (ATAPE) is an inspired process to speedup the parallel and distributed computing. Recently, ATAPE algorithms were successfully applied on multistage interconnection networks (MINs), including baseline and butterfly networks. However, routing of those algorithms on MINs relies on switch-patterns for stage-control from sources (S), which is a half-routing solution since they cannot perform a full self-routing with the (S, D) protocol for all MINs. In this paper, first we propose a full-routing solution of the realizing ATAPE on a class of d-nary-switch MINs(+) (i.e., baseline(+), butterfly(+), etc.). Our ATAPE can be embedded on-chip effectively for not only (S, D) self-routing but also stage-/switch-control routing. Two embedded ATAPE functions incorporate with multi-stage pipelining are proposed in optimal O(N + log(2) N): 1. a (default) static function D = S XOR (C + order) mod N and 2. an (optional) f-in-1 dynamic function D = rho [(S + C + order) mod N] with the incrementing counter C = 0 to N - 1. Second, we introduce a crossbar of MINs(+) with fewer delay-stages to achieve the ultimate ATAPE embedding. Finally, experimental results of applying ATAPE on such MINs(+) are confirmed fruitfully, including the ATAPE-based NxN-matrix transposition in O(N + log(2) N), which yields the significant speedup.

The pitch of the circular moire is preselected in such a way that angular oscillations of different amplitudes yield time-averaged moire fringes at different locations of the cover image. This optical effect enables to construct an optical scale for direct measurement of angular oscillations. The proposed technique is similar to visual cryptography, which is a cryptographic technique that allows encryption of visual information in such a way, that decryption can be done without use of any computational device. The efficiency and the applicability of the proposed technique for performance degradation prediction of rotating mechanical components is illustrated and validated by computational simulations and experimental tests.

"A multifunctional platform based on the microhotplate was developed for applications including a Pirani vacuum gauge, temperature, and gas sensor. It consisted of a tungsten microhotplate and an on-chip operational amplifier. The platform was fabricated in a standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process. A tungsten plug in standard CMOS process was specially designed as the serpentine resistor for the microhotplate, acting as both heater and thermister. With the sacrificial layer technology, the microhotplate was suspended over the silicon substrate with a 340 nm gap. The on-chip operational amplifier provided a bias current for the microhotplate. This platform has been used to develop different kinds of sensors. The first one was a Pirani vacuum gauge ranging from 10(-1) to 10(5) Pa. The second one was a temperature sensor ranging from -20 to 70 degrees C.

Research results indicated that the neural computing techniques could be successfully employed in modelling crew productivity. It was also found that successful models could be developed with different combinations of input factors, and several of the models which excluded one or more input factors turned out to be better than the baseline models. Based on the MAPE values obtained for the models, the RBNN technique was found to be better than the FFNN technique, although both slightly overestimated the masons' productivity.

"A vast majority of menopausal women suffer from vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flushes and night sweats, the mean duration of which may be up to 7-10 years. In addition to a decreased quality of life, vasomotor symptoms may have an impact on overall health. Vasomotor symptoms are associated with overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system, and sympathetic overdrive in turn is associated with metabolic syndrome, which is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Menopausal hot flushes have a complex relationship to different features of the metabolic syndrome and not all data point towards an association between vasomotor symptoms and metabolic syndrome. Thus, it is still unclear whether vasomotor symptoms are an independent risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Research in this area is constantly evolving and we present here the most recent data on the possible association between menopausal vasomotor symptoms and the metabolic syndrome.

"An alternative approach to conceptualizing and measuring the built environment is developed which forms the basis of a new assessment tool. The role of buildings is reframed to consider what capabilities for sustainability a building can provide to the inhabitants and local community. This capability to support sustainability is defined as the ability to improve the local quality of life (Human Development Index) whilst remaining below the environmental carrying capacity (environmental footprint). This approach has clear implications about the role of buildings in enabling residents and users to achieve these targets and outcomes. This shifts the focus of net-positive development toward configurations and characteristics of the built environment that are appropriate for a particular context. A Built Environment Sustainability Tool (BEST) is presented that defines and assesses these configurations and characteristics. Assessments can be conducted by measuring the extent to which required configurations and characteristics exist (i.e. 'the capability of the built environment to support sustainability'). BEST is compared with other green building rating tool approaches in order to review the methodology critically and to evaluate this as a means of improving built environment sustainability performance.

"A previous article published in Prevention Science 3 years ago (Heinrichs et al. 2014) presented the results of a randomized controlled trial of the Triple P group program 4 years (FU4) after administration as a universal prevention approach in preschools. The present addendum resolves inconsistencies in outcome reporting (e.g., total scores of scales versus subscale scores) and provides information on measures that were additionally available to analyze further potential effects of the intervention. Effects in secondary outcome domains not reported in Heinrichs et al. (2014) are furthermore analyzed and reported. The original data analyses were varied using a different statistical model in this addendum. Re-analyses supported the original results, including changes in self-reported maternal and paternal positive parenting, in maternal dysfunctional parenting behavior as well as in maternal reports of child behavior. In addition, when analyzing the externalizing and internalizing dimensions, analysis revealed a statistically significant change in externalizing but not internalizing child symptoms. No significant intervention effects were found for secondary outcome domains. Considering important limitations in the study design [such as baseline differences at pre-assessment with mothers from intervention preschools reporting more child behavioral problems prior to introducing the intervention and predominantly non-significant effects from (a) fathers perspective, (b) teacher ratings at 1-year follow up (FU1), and (c) behavioral observations at FU1], we believe that this trial alone cannot be taken as sufficient evidence for a significant and meaningful change in child behavioral problems, which is the ultimate goal of child prevention programs. Therefore, future studies need to replicate and extend upon these results by including larger sample sizes and overcome the discussed limitations.

"Adding the number of computing nodes is a common approach to achieving higher performance in a parallel computing system. However, with constraint of fixed system architecture and fixed algorithm structure, it is difficult to improve the performance of parallel computing only by extending its scale absolutely. To realize such extension with fixed structure, we analyze key factors from architecture and parallel task, which affect the scalability, and then use the weighted graph to model architecture as well as parallel task. Especially, focusing on the case that architecture graph and parallel task graph are homogeneous, we propose the extension method of graph similarity; for the case that architecture graph and parallel task graph are heterogeneous, a critical-path-unchanged scaling method is proposed. Actually, the above two extending methods do not change the graph's structure. They only adjust the node weight and edge-weight in the relevant graph. Furthermore, through mathematical derivation, some conclusions about the new scaling methods are drawn. Finally, in order to verify the effectiveness, some simulative experiments are conducted on the platform SimGrid. The experimental results show that the proposed methods can realize iso-speed-efficiency extension, and can guide practical extensions for parallel computing.

We analyzed the expression of the CIRH1A ribosomal protein in colorectal carcinoma and para-carcinoma samples by bioinformatics analyses of data extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas and in colorectal cancer cell lines in vitro by qPCR. CIRH1A was highly expressed in carcinoma samples and colorectal cancer cells. We also transduced the RKO colorectal cancer (CRC) cell line with lentivirus-mediated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and studied the impact that this knockdown of CIRH1A expression had on cell growth. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated inhibition of CIRH1A expression significantly suppressed proliferation and increased apoptosis of transduced cells, and tended to arrest them in G(1) phase. Our data suggest that CIRH1A plays a critical role in the proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis of human malignant colorectal cells, and might therefore be a potential target for therapeutic strategies.

The plans were valid for fifty years in the management of the city's urban development. They find their origins in Karl Brunner's studies and proposals between 7929 and 7932 and in the draft project that made them possible during his second stay in 1934, which Robert Humeres finally developed in the five coming years. The problem we approach in this article is, therefore, related to the capacity of this cartography to contain a specific idea of ""modern city"". In fact, the thesis of this article is that the Official Plan gives an account of both, an existing city, rigorously registered, and a new one arising as a product of its transformation according to the indications represented on it. In this double intentionality underlies, from our point of view, a clearly ""modern"" bias, evidenced in both the willingness for understanding the new that comes from the pre-existent phenomenon, as the necessary abstraction its representation should achieve to allow both worlds to cohabitate in the plan. This observation is confirmed when we prove the plan is configured from three types of lines that synthetize the complexity of the public space.

"A 4-year-old boy was referred to the nephrologist with daytime urinary incontinence and suspicion of an overactive bladder. At the age of 17 months he had been referred to the pediatric endocrinologist because of polyuria and polydipsia in order to exclude diabetes insipidus. Repeated water deprivation tests and a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain were normal. Diabetes insipidus was excluded, and primary polydipsia was thought to be most likely since diabetes mellitus also had been excluded. At the current presentation, he drank up to 3 L a day and quite often had wet diapers. He also seemed to pass stools infrequently and with difficulty. Curiously his grandmother had similar symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia since childhood and had been diagnosed with primary polydipsia. The physical examination of our pediatric patient was normal. In the differential diagnosis we included diabetes insipidus but also contemplated other possibilities, such as nephronophthisis, tubulopathies and hypercalciuria. Laboratory results including urinalysis and an ultrasound of the kidney did not show any abnormalities, making a tubulopathy or hypercalciuria unlikely. A desmopressin test by the intravenous route came back completely normal, pointing to another cause than diabetes insipidus. Genetic testing for the nephronophthisis came back negative but was positive for a missense mutation in the AVPR2 gene (p.Arg104Cys) associated with partial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. He was started on daily desmopressin. Within 3 days the urinary incontinence resolved as did the polyuria and faecal incontinence. His grandmother was referred to the geneticist and eventually the adult nephrologist. This case highlights the importance of being thorough when confronted with a difficult diagnosis. It also emphasizes that a test result does not necessarily equate to the presence or absence of a condition since the test with 100 % sensitivity and specificity has yet to be discovered.

"Aggregate makes up a high mass fraction in asphalt pavements. The morphological characteristics of aggregate (i.e., shape factors, angularity, and surface texture) significantly affect the mechanical performance of asphalt pavement. Extensive investigations of aggregate morphology have been conducted on coarse aggregate in recent years; however the analysis of fine aggregate has not been carried out up to date. Commonly used methods to extrapolate information on the morphology of fine aggregate such as sand flow test (SFT) and Uncompacted Void Content Test (UVCT) give a general characterization of the aggregate morphology without allowing for differentiated conclusions regarding the respective morphological factors. In this study digital image processing (DIP) is used to determine morphological index values of fine aggregate. Data from DIP is compared with results from UVCT and SFT by means of correlation analyses to investigate the applicability and precision of the respective methods. UVCT and SFT are found to be strongly reliable on the absolute grain size rendering the methods less resilient. DIP is very well suited to determine specific morphological indices of fine aggregates and is a useful tool for the design of asphalt mixtures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Among them, the most potent compound, 37 (QG368), showed 72.3% inhibition even at a low concentration of 0.1 mu M, which was about 188-fold more potent than the lead compound. Cytotoxicity test on BMMs indicated that the inhibition on osteoclast differentiation of 37 did not result from its cytotoxicity. Moreover, 37 also showed no obvious effect on osteoblast differentiation. Mechanistic studies disclosed that 37 can inhibit the expression of osteoclastogenesis-related marker genes, including Nfatcl, TRAP, cathepsin K, C-src and CTR. In particular, 37 could decrease the ovariectomy-induced osteoclast activity and relieve the osteoporosis obviously in vivo.

The target is first in first out (FIFO) systems, in which the precedence relations are represented by a directed acyclic graph. Using max-plus algebra, a system's behavior can be described by a set of linear equations referred to as the state space representation. Using this representation, we address the problem of adjusting system parameters and determining optimal control inputs for given reference signals. To determine system parameters, we formulate and solve an optimization problem using a branch-and-bound method, by which the number of constraints is reduced. Then, the optimal control inputs are determined. Since this part is often the bottleneck in online control, we propose two methods for the efficient computation thereof. The first method is beneficial for systems with sparse adjacency matrices and small-scale systems with a greater prediction horizon. In contrast, the second approach is beneficial for larger-scale systems with a smaller prediction horizon. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is verified through numerical simulations.

"Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) could be a precious opportunity for patients to reveal concealed diseases other than conventional risk factors for ACS, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, etc. In the setting of ACS, the intracoronary and systemic prothrombotic environment has led to an increase in the risk of stent thrombosis of which mortality was higher among patients with ACS, especially with the highest mortality in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction. The some specific conditions which were concealed beyond the cardiovascular pathophysiology except well-known risk factors for ACS and stent thrombosis might involve the onset of ACS. We describe a case of a 64-year-old man who was admitted to intensive care unit for chest pain. This case found the possibility that polycythemia vera with Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation might be a underlying disease of ACS with stent thrombosis, and highlighted the importance of recognizing polycythemia vera with JAK2 V617F mutation as concealed disease for cardiologists. We would like to report and review the relationship between ACS and polycythemia vera with JAK2 V617F mutation.

"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors are currently the most widely prescribed drugs for Alzheimer's disease. The high potential of indole compounds in medicinal chemistry led us to discover a novel series of fluoroindole compounds. The synthesis and pharmacological analysis of the difluoropyrido[4,3-b]indoles 11-34 are described. Compounds 11-34 were tested for AChE inhibition activity using a rat brain homogenate. Compounds 25-29 display a promising in vitro profile with an IC50 value range of 46-51.6nM and show significant protective effect on scopolamine-induced amnesia. The present data indicate that compounds 25-29 may represent attractive potent molecules for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

"An ""edaphic-landscape"" restoration was performed in two anthracite coal mine spoil heaps located in NW Spain as a demonstration and pilot program for the restoration of coal mine spoils. Terrestrial arthropods were used to monitor the process as an alternative to the use of secondary succession of plants or physico-chemical indicators of soils. This study analyzes the usefulness of the terrestrial arthropods at different taxonomic levels (orders of Arthropoda, families of Coleoptera, and species of Carabidae) as restoration indicators in the initial restoration stages. The terrestrial arthropods respond rapidly to restoration, and the results may be explained by short-term increase in abiotic factors resulting from the applied techniques, mainly the animal origin of the organic matter added and the biodegradable coconut geotextile. Carabidae is of relatively low value as a short-term restoration indicator at a specific level. Coleoptera provided the best information for interpreting the ecological results over the short term and had the best relationship with the cost of identification. Likewise, the results showed that the edaphic-landscape restoration leads to an abnormal arthropod assemblage in the short term because of an excessive abundance of isopods and polydesmids. No clear convergence appeared toward any of the terrestrial arthropod communities present in the grassland, scrubland, or woodland semi-natural areas, which were used as reference end point. The restoration indicator value produced by the higher taxonomic levels of the studied terrestrial arthropods may be useful and cost-effective for assessing short-term changes caused by environmental restorations performed to recover ecosystems affected by mining activities.

"A new adaptive filtering algorithm for time-series data based on the QRD inverse-updates method of Pan and Plemmons is derived from first principles. In common with other fast algorithms for time-series adaptive filtering, this algorithm only requires O(p) operations for the solution of a pth-order problem. Unlike previous fast algorithms based on the QRD technique, the algorithm presented here explicitly produces the transversal filter weights. Furthermore the derivation of the algorithm is achieved, quite simply, by means of signal-flow-graph manipulation. The relationship between this fast QRD inverse-updates algorithm and the FTF algorithm is briefly discussed. The results of some preliminary computer simulations of the algorithm, using finite-precision floating-point arithmetic, are presented.

"A nonlinear Schrodinger equation with self-consistent sources can be used to describe the interaction between an high-frequency electrostatic wave and an ion-acoustic wave in two-component homogeneous plasmas. In this paper, breather and rogue waves solutions for such a system are investigated via the Darboux transformation. The spatially and temporally periodic breathers have been found. When the cubic nonlinearity coefficient and the background amplitude are varied, the propagating trajectories of breather are changed. The interaction between two breathers are also studied, which shows that when the wave numbers are close, the two breathers are partially coalesced. All of the first-, second-, and third-order rogue waves present certain lumps or valleys around a center in the temporal-spatial distribution, and the peak heights of the ion-acoustic waves are more than three times those of the background. However, for the high-frequency electrostatic waves, the values around the centers are less than the background intensity.

"A hybrid structure consisting of iron oxide nanoparticles decorated on titania (TiO2) nanotube arrays has been synthesized by a very rapid forced hydrolysis method, followed by post annealing treatment. The morphology and structure analysis of the hybrid TiO2/Fe2O3 composites indicated uniform, conformal coating of the hematite nanoparticles on the anatase titania nanotubes. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was used to investigate the absorption properties of the TiO2/Fe2O3 structures. An increase in the absorbance of visible light in the range 380 nm to 600 nm has been observed when compared with pristine nanotubes. This is similar to the visible light absorbance enhancement observed in Ru-dye sensitized titania nanotubes. Thus iron oxide decorated titania nanotube demonstrate immense potential for use as inexpensive and robust materials for improved solar energy harvesting for photovoltaic applications.

"A characteristic feature of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is accumulation of apoptotic resistant fibroblasts/myofibroblasts in the fibroblastic foci. As caveolin (Cav)-null mice develop pulmonary fibrosis (PF), we hypothesized that the participating fibroblasts display an apoptosis-resistant phenotype. To test this hypothesis and identify the molecular mechanisms involved we isolated lung fibroblasts from Cav-null mice and examined the expression of several inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs), of c-FLIP, of Bcl-2 proteins and of the death receptor CD95/Fas. We found significant increase in XIAP and c-FLIP constitutive protein expression with no alteration of Bcl-2 and lower levels of CD95/Fas. The isolated fibroblasts were then treated with the CD95/Fas ligand (FasL) to induce apoptosis. While the morphological and biochemical alterations induced by FasL were similar in wild-type (wt) and Cav-null mouse lung fibroblasts, the time course and the extent of the alterations were greater in the Cav-null fibroblasts. Several salient features of Cav-null fibroblasts response such as loss of membrane potential, fragmentation of the mitochondrial continuum concurrent with caspase-8 activation, and subsequent Bid cleavage, prior to caspase-3 activation were detected. Furthermore, M30 antigen formation, phosphatidylserine expression and DNA fragmentation were caspase-3 dependent. SiRNA-mediated silencing of XIAP and c-FLIP, individually or combined, enhanced the sensitivity of lung fibroblasts to FasL-induced apoptosis. Pharmacological inhibition of Bcl-2 had no effect. Together our findings support a mechanism in which CD95/Fas engagement activates caspase-8, inducing mitochondrial apoptosis through Bid cleavage. XIAP and c-FLIP fine tune this process in a cell-type specific manner.

"Adtpp is an open-source tool that adds support for algebraic data types (ADTs) to the C programming language. ADTs allow more precise description of program types and more robust handling of data structures than are directly supported by C. ADT definitions and other declarations are put in a file that is preprocessed by adtpp to produce a C header (.h') file that can be included in C source files. The generated header file contains C type definitions, macros, and inline functions that support type-safe construction, deconstruction, and pattern matching of ADT values while avoiding unsafe operations such as casts, and avoiding the risk of errors such as dereferencing NULL pointers and accessing inappropriate fields of unions. Values are represented efficiently, using techniques from the implementation of declarative languages. For many simple data types, the memory representation is identical to a direct implementation in C, with no loss of efficiency. For more complex types, the adtpp representation is more efficient than common C representations while preserving type safety and convenience. As an example, we present a new variation of 234-trees that is very compact. Adtpp also supports parametric polymorphism such as defining a type list of t', where t can be any ADT, and generic functions such as length. However, polymorphic code is somewhat more verbose than for typical declarative languages, due to our reliance on the limited type checking available in C. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this paper, we propose a real-time detection scheme against false data injection attack in smart grid networks. Unlike the classical detection test, the proposed algorithm is able to tackle the unknown parameters with low complexity and process multiple measurements at once, leading to a shorter decision time and a better detection accuracy. The objective is to detect the adversary as quickly as possible while satisfying certain detection error constraints. A Markov-chain-based analytical model is constructed to systematically analyze the proposed scheme. With the analytical model, we are able to configure the system parameters for guaranteed performance in terms of false alarm rate, average detection delay, and missed detection ratio under a detection delay constraint.

The model is based on the spatial discretization of the linearized Navier-Stokes equation combined with the vortex cylinder theory. The spatial discretization of the model is performed using the finite difference method, which provides the state-space form of the dynamic wind farm model. The model provides an approximation of the behavior of the flow in the wind farm and obtains the wind speed in the vicinity of each wind turbine. Afterwards, the model is validated using measurement data of Energy research Center of the Netherlands' Wind turbine Test site in Wieringermeer in the Netherlands and by employing the outcomes of two other wind flow models. The end goal of this work is to present the wind farm flow model by ordinary differential equations, to be applied in wind farm control algorithms along with load and power optimizations.

"A Summary As elderly patients with hip osteoarthritis aged, acetabular dysplasia parameters decreased (Sharp's angle, acetabular roof obliquity angle, and acetabular head index) and the incidence of the atrophic type increased. Vertebral body fracture was more frequent in the atrophic type, suggesting the involvement of osteoporosis at the onset of hip osteoarthritis. Introduction Osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with increased bone formation at a local site. However, excessive bone resorption has also been found to occur in the early stages of OA. Osteoporosis may be involved in the onset of OA in elderly patients. We conducted a cross-sectional radiographic study of patients with hip OA and examined the association between age and factors of acetabular dysplasia (Sharp's angle, acetabular roof obliquity angle, and acetabular head index) as well as the osteoblastic response to determine the potential involvement of osteoporosis. Methods This study included 366 patients (58 men, 308 women) who had undergone total hip arthroplasty for the diagnosis of hip OA. We measured the parameters of acetabular dysplasia using preoperative frontal X-ray images and evaluated each patient according to Bombelli classification of OA (hypertrophic, normotrophic, or atrophic type). Results As the patients aged, the parameters of acetabular dysplasia decreased. The incidence of the atrophic type of OA was significantly higher in older patients. Vertebral body fractures were more frequent in the atrophic type than in the other types. Additionally, the index of acetabular dysplasia was lower in the atrophic type. By contrast, the hypertrophic type was present in relatively younger patients and was associated with an increased index of acetabular dysplasia. Conclusion In elderly patients with hip OA, the parameters of acetabular dysplasia decreased and the incidence of the atrophic type increased as the patients aged. The frequency of vertebral body fracture was high in patients with the atrophic type, suggesting the involvement of osteoporosis in the onset of hip OA.

"A rainwater harvesting system (RHS) was designed for a waste treatment facility located near the town of Mirandela (northern Portugal), to be used in the washing of vehicles and other equipment, the cleaning of outside concrete or asphalt floors, and the watering of green areas. Water tank volumes representing 100% efficiency (V-r) were calculated by the Ripple method with different results depending on two consumption scenarios adopted for irrigation. The RHS design was based on a precipitation record spanning a rather long period (3 decades). The calculated storage capacities fulfilled the water demand even when prolonged droughts occurred during that timeframe. However, because the drought events have been rather scarce the V-r values were considered oversized and replaced by optimal volumes. Notwithstanding the new volumes were solely half of the original V-r values, the projected RHS efficiency remained very high (around 90%) while the probability of system failure (efficiency < 100%) stayed very low (in the order of 5%). In both scenarios, the economic savings related to the optimization of V-r were noteworthy, while the investment's return periods decreased substantially from the original to the optimized solutions. A high efficiency with a low storage capacity is typical of low demanding applications of rainwater harvesting, where water availability (V-w) largely exceeds water demand (C-w), that is to say where demand fractions (C-w/V-w) are very low. Based on the results of a literature review covering an ample geographic distribution and describing a very large number of demand fraction scenarios, a C-w/V-w = 0.8 was defined as the threshold to generally distinguish the low from the high demanding RHS applications.

"Accurately monitoring global vegetation dynamics with modern remote sensing is critical for understanding the functions and processes of the biosphere and its interactions with the planetary climate. The MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation index (VI) product has been a primary data source for this purpose. To date, the MODIS team had released several versions of VI products that have widely used in global change studies and practical applications. In this study, we re-examined the global vegetation activity by comparing the recent MODIS Collection 6 (C6) VIs with Collection 5 (C5) VIs including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from Terra (2001-2015) and Aqua Satellites (2003-2015). We found substantial differences in global vegetation trends betweenTerra-C5 and -C6 VIs, especially EVI. From 2001 to 2015, global vegetation showed a remarkable greening trend in annual EVI from the Terra-C6 (0.28% year(-1) P < 0.001), in contrast to the decreasing EVI trend from the Terra-05 (-0.14% year(-1) P < 0.01). Spatially, large portions of the browning areas in tropical regions identified by Terra-05 VIs were not evident in Terra-C6 VIs. In contrast, the widespread greening areas in Terra-C6 VIs were consistent with Aqua C6 VIs and GIMMS3g NDVI. Our finding of a greening Earth supports the recent studies suggesting an enhanced land carbon sink. Our study suggests that most of the vegetation browning trends detected by MODIS Terra-C5 VIs were likely caused by sensor degradation, particularly for the period after 2007. Therefore, previous studies of temporal vegetation trends based solely on Terra-C5 VIs may need to be reevaluated. Our new analysis offers the most updated understanding of the global vegetation dynamics during the past 15 years and contributes to accurately understanding the role of vegetation played in the Earth's biogeochemical and climatic systems.

"Allocating memory dynamically for virtual machines (VMs) according to their demands provides significant benefits as well as great challenges. Efficient memory resource management requires knowledge of the memory demands of applications or systems at runtime. A widely proposed approach is to construct a miss ratio curve (MRC) for a VM, which not only summarizes the current working set size (WSS) of the VM but also models the relationship between its performance and the target memory allocation size. Unfortunately, the cost of monitoring and maintaining the MRC structures is nontrivial. This article first introduces a low-cost WSS tracking system with effective optimizations on data structures, as well as an efficient mechanism to decrease the frequency of monitoring. We also propose a Memory Balancer (MEB), which dynamically reallocates guest memory based on the predicted WSS. Our experimental results show that our prediction schemes yield a high accuracy of 95.2% and low overhead of 2%. Furthermore, the overall system throughput can be significantly improved with MEB, which brings a speedup up to 7.4 for two to four VMs and 4.54 for an overcommitted system with 16 VMs.

"A robust control technique is proposed to address the problem of trajectory tracking of an autonomous ground vehicle (AGV). This technique utilizes a fractional-order proportional integral derivative (FOPID) controller to control a non-holonomic autonomous ground vehicle to track the behaviour of the predefined reference path. Two FOPID controllers are designed to control the AGV's inputs. These inputs represent the torques that are used in order to manipulate the implemented model of the vehicle to obtain the actual path. The implemented model of the non-holonomic autonomous ground vehicle takes into consideration both of the kinematic and dynamic models. In additional, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize the FOPID controllers' parameters. These optimal tuned parameters of FOPID controllers minimize the cost function used in the algorithm. The effectiveness and validation of the proposed method have been verified through different patterns of reference paths using MATLAB-Simulink software package. The stability of fractional-order system is analysed. Also, the robustness of the system is conducted by adding disturbances due to friction of wheels during the vehicle motion. The obtained results of FOPID controller show the advantage and the performance of the technique in terms of minimizing path tracking error and the complement of the path following.

"A universal aptameric system based on the taking advantage of double-stranded DNA/perylene diimide (dsDNA/PDI) as the signal probe was developed for multiplexed detection of small molecules. Aptamers are single-stranded DNA or RNA oligonucleotides which are selected in vitro by a process known as systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment. In this work, we synthesized a new kind of PDI and reported this aggregated PDI could quench the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-labeled fluorophores with a high quenching efficiency. The quenching efficiencies on the fluorescence of FAM, TAMRA and Cy5 could reach to 98.3% +/- 0.9%, 97.2% +/- 0.6% and 98.1% +/- 1.1%, respectively. This broad-spectrum quencher was then adopted to construct a multicolor biosensor via a label-free approach. A structure-switching-triggered enzymatic recycling amplification was employed for signal amplification. High quenching efficiency combined with autocatalytic target recycling amplification afforded the biosensor with high sensitivity towards small analytes. For other targets, changing the corresponding aptamer can achieve the goal. The quencher did not interfere with the catalytic activity of nuclease. The biosensor could be manipulated with similar sensitivity no matter in pre-addition or post-addition manner.

"Aberrant expression of miRNAs is involved in several carcinogenic processes, including tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine the role of miR-218 in gastric cancer angiogenesis. In situ hybridization was performed on a set of tissue microarray samples to assess the difference in miR-218 expression in vessels between tumor tissues and normal gastric mucosa. In vitro, ectopic expression of miR-218 disturbed the tubular structure and inhibited the migration of endothelial cells. Motility and tube formation were rescued when miR-218 was downregulated. Moreover, miR-218 suppressed endothelial cell sprouting in a fibrin bead sprouting assay. Subsequently, we identified ROBO1 as a target of miR-218 in endothelial cells and determined it was responsible for the effect of miR-218 on tumor angiogenesis. In vivo, local injection of mature miR-218 in xenografted tumors disrupted the vessel plexus and thus inhibited tumor growth. Taken together, our study demonstrated an anti-angiogenic role of miR-218 in gastric cancer and indicated that delivery of miR-218 may be a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit tumor angiogenesis.

"A microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a very promising way to remove organic pollutants. Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) is a widely used agricultural pesticide. In this study, single-chamber and membrane-less soil MFCs were constructed. The HCB was degraded to pentachlorobenzene (PeCB), tetrachlorobenzene (TeCB), and trichlorobenzene (TCB) in sequence by a reductive dechlorination process in soil MFCs. The influences of the external resistance, concentration of phosphate buffer, and electrode spacing in soil MFCs on the degradation rate and removal efficiency of HCB were analyzed. The results showed that the degradation rate and removal efficiency of HCB were increased when the external resistance decreased from 2000 to 20 (1, and also when the concentration of phosphate buffer increased. The anode area played a significant role in dechlorination of HCB. Altering the spacing of the reducing electrode resulted in a lower ohmic resistance in the soil MFCs. The ohmic resistance was negatively correlated with the removal efficiency and degradation rate (P < 0.05). In conclusion, HCB removal efficiency could be enhanced by soil MFCs, the performance of which was improved by a decrease in external resistance and internal resistance, and an increase in phosphate buffer concentration, rather than just by shortening the electrode spacing.

"Acetabular dysplasia is a known cause of hip osteoarthritis. In addition to abnormal anatomy, changes in kinematics, joint reaction forces (JRFs), and muscle forces could cause tissue damage to the cartilage and labrum, and may contribute to pain and fatigue. The objective of this study was to compare lower extremity joint angles, moments, hip JRFs and muscle forces during gait between patients with symptomatic acetabular dysplasia and healthy controls. Marker trajectories and ground reaction forces were measured in 10 dysplasia patients and 10 typically developing control subjects. A musculoskeletal model was scaled in OpenSim to each subject and subject-specific hip joint centers were determined using reconstructions from CT images. Joint kinematics and moments were calculated using inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics, respectively. Muscle forces and hip JRFs were estimated with static optimization. Inter-group differences were tested for statistical significance (p= 0.8). Results demonstrated that dysplasia patients had higher medially directed JRFs. Joint angles and moments were mostly similar between the groups, but large inter-group effect sizes suggested some restriction in range of motion by patients at the hip and ankle. Higher medially-directed JRFs and inter-group differences in hip muscle forces likely stem from lateralization of the hip joint center in dysplastic patients. Joint force differences, combined with reductions in range of motion at the hip and ankle may also indicate compensatory strategies by patients with dysplasia to maintain joint stability.

"A straightforward and facile method for the exfoliation of graphene sheets using poly(vinylpyrrolidone) nanoparticles of an average size of 42 nm was developed and their dual role as pH-sensitive drug carrier and anti-cancer agent was evaluated. The cytotoxic impact of the exfoliated nanosheets (GRP-PVP-NP) was examined on various cells (HCT-116, HeLa, SCC-9, NIH-3T3 and HEK-293 cells) by a series of assays. Their cytotoxic nature was attributed to affecting the mitochondrial enzyme activity, proliferation capability, and the formation of tight junctions in cancer cells. The endocytosis was found to be internalization mechanism for the cellular uptake of nanosheets. The generation of reactive oxygen species and elicitation of caspase-3 activity which was undoubtedly associated with triggering of oxidative stress speculated to be the dominant cause of the cytotoxic pattern of nanosheets against cancer cells. Additionally, the results also showed the role of the nanosheets as a pH-sensitive drug carrier through drug loading by supramolecular interaction. The efficient release of doxorubicin was seen at low pH and in an environment with a low oxygen concentration, thus under conditions mimicking the typical tumor microenvironment.

"A regional-level and dimensionless analysis for designing a domestic rainwater harvesting system (DRWHS) was developed. To consider various combinations of water demand, storage capacity, effective roof area, and rainfall in DRWHS design, two dimensionless ratios were used, namely, demand fraction and storage fraction, along with a relationship between the two ratios. Firstly, Northern Taiwan was divided into four sub-regions through cluster analysis based on the average annual 10-day rainfall distribution at rainfall stations and administrative districts. Easy-to-use dimensionless curves between demand fraction and storage fraction were obtained for five rainwater supply reliabilities of the DRWHS for the four sub-regions. Based on the dimensionless curves, a nomogram was constructed for designing DRWHSs at a rainwater supply reliability of 95% in the sub-region I. Storage capacities determined from the dimensionless curves showed a close fit with those determined from simulated values, but were larger than the values estimated from the method presented in the Green Building Evaluation Manual in most situations. The methodology developed herein can be used effectively for the preliminary design of a DRWHS and for overcoming the difficulties faced in designing a DRWHS without rainfall data and with incomplete rainfall data.

The major factors governing the variation in Z(sd), namely, turbidity and length attenuation coefficient (1/(c + K-d), c = beam attenuation coefficient; K-d = diffuse attenuation coefficient at 531 nm), are obtained based on band rationing techniques. It was found that the band ratio of remote sensing reflectance (expressed as (R-rs(443) + R-rs(490))/ (R-rs(555) + R-rs(670)) contains essential information about the water column optical properties and thereby positively correlates to turbidity. The beam attenuation coefficient (c) at 531 nm is obtained by a linear relationship with turbidity. To derive the vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) at 531 nm, K-d(490) is estimated as a function of reflectance ratio (R-rs(670)/R-rs(490)), which provides the bio-optical link between chlorophyll concentration and K-d(531). The present algorithm was applied to MODIS-Aqua images, and the results were evaluated by matchup comparisons between the remotely estimated Z(sd) and in situ Z(sd) in coastal waters off Point Calimere and its adjoining regions on the southeast coast of India. The results showed the pattern of increasing Z(sd) from shallow turbid waters to deep clear waters. The statistical evaluation of the results showed that the percent mean relative error between the MODIS-Aqua-derived Z(sd) and in situ Z(sd) values was within +/- 25%. A close agreement achieved in spatial contours of MODIS-Aqua-derived Z(sd) and in situ Z(sd) for the month of January 2014 and August 2013 promises the model capability to yield accurate estimates of Zsd in coastal, estuarine, and inland waters. The spatial contours have been included to provide the best data visualization of the measured, modeled (in situ), and satellite-derived Z(sd) products. The modeled and satellite-derived Z(sd) values were compared with measurement data which yielded RMSE = 0.079, MRE = -0.016, and R-2 = 0.95 for the modeled Z(sd) and RMSE = 0.075, MRE = 0.020, and R-2 = 0.95 for the satellite-derived Z(sd) products.

"A structurally simple, water-soluble rhodamine-derivatived fluorescent probe, which is responsive to acidic pH, was conveniently synthesized via a one-step condensation reaction of rhodamine B hydrazide and 4-formybenzene-1,3-disulfonate. As a stable and highly sensitive pH sensor, the probe displays an approximately 50-fold fluorescence enhancement over the pH range of 7.16-4.89 as the structure of probe changes from spirocyclic (weak fluorescent) to ring-open (strong fluorescent) with decreasing pH. The synthesized fluorescent probe is applied to the detection of pH changes in vitro and in vivo bioimaging of immortalized gastric cancer cells, with satisfactory results.

"A new look at the description of the phenomenon of electromagnetic wave radiation as a phase transition of a quasi-static field state (near zone) in the field of running wave (far zone) is suggested. It is demonstrated that the boundary of this transition, called the causal surface, is sufficiently localized. The position of the causal surface depends on the chosen radiation frequency. The skin layer in media with strong absorption is formed at the boundary of the causal surface, and this can be used for depth sensing of such media.

"African American families' experiences with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have received little attention in the research literature. Guided by the life-course perspective, we analyzed qualitative interview data from members of 27 African American families including the person with MCI (PwMCI), a relative or friend who was highly involved in the PwMCI's daily life, and if available, a relative or friend who had at least monthly contact with the PwMCI. Findings uncovered variability in families' MCI awareness, assessment, and need for role changes; the importance of reaching out to trusted others; and honoring PwMCI's care preferences (e.g., who should provide care). Families held varying beliefs about engaging outside support; some families insisted on keeping all care within the family while others were open to the use of external services. We showcase how diagnosis acceptance and family decision-making are at the heart of how African American families respond to MCI.

"A low energy- noise switched-capacitor (SC) sensor interface for resistive bridge sensor is presented. The SC amplifier achieves low-power metric with two operating modes using operation-phase-dependent biasing and compensation scheme in the op-amp design. This novel op-amp works in high-bandwidth high-power mode to sample the bridge signal for 13 mu s twice and in low-bandwidth low-power mode for 474 mu s over 500 mu s measurement interval. To further reduce the power of the SC amplifier in system level, a SC level-shift design is adopted. Regarding offset calibration, a capacitor divider based trimming scheme is implemented to generate the mid-point DC output voltage under the constraint of the feedback capacitor size. Implemented in 65 nm CMOS, the SC interface together with the regulator, voltage reference and trimming circuit occupies an area of 0.358 mm(2). For the first test setup utilizing Half Wheatstone Bridge, the proposed SC amplifier consumes 12.3 mu W at 1 V regulated supply with a 2 kHz system clock. The measured Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of SC circuit is 55.6 dB. In the second test setup using a commercial sensor with 0.092 mV/kPa sensitivity, the interface has demonstrated the sensing function with sensitivity of 3.52 mV/kPa. Finally, compared to the representative prior-arts, this work has achieved the best energy-noise figure-of-merit at identical fractional resistance change.

"A piezoelectric-based hydraulic actuator is a type of piston-cylinder device which is operated by internal flow energy. Recently, an artificial muscle and a micro actuator have been developed using a new smart material and internal flow control. Thus, the actuating velocity of the fabricated integrated hybrid system was investigated using the pumping frequency and load weight. The actuating velocity was then calculated using a developed program, and the numerical result was compared with the experimental result to validate the numerical program. Also, the internal flow rate was measured to analyze the pump efficiency experimentally. The flow rate inside the integrated hybrid actuator calculated using a CFD program for various pumping frequencies was then compared with the experimental results. The maximum outlet velocity was obtained at the pumping frequency of 35 Hz and the velocity decreased from that point due to flow loss.

Smartphone operating systems such as Android are being used to interface with and manage various IoT systems, such as building management and home automation systems. In such a hostile environment the ability to test and confirm device health claims is important to preserve confidentiality of user data. This paper describes a study to determine whether an Android device could be secured to prevent malware from executing in parallel with trusted applications. The research also sought to determine whether the system image could be protected from unauthorised modifications. A prototype scheme for meeting the above requirements was developed and tested. It was observed that the prototype succeeded in preventing unauthorised modification to the system image of the test device.

"Although studies based on satellite gravimetry (2003 2010) and laser altimetry (2003-2009) measurements have achieved region-wide glacier mass change for the Tien Shan, the dynamic process of glacier yet to be closely monitored and understood so that its impact can be assessed accurately. In this study, we investigated region wide glacier thickness change in the Central Tien Shan (CTS) during 2000-2012 by differencing the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) with a newly constructed DEM from 27 TanDEM-X images. For a total glacier area of 7239.8 +/- 527.2 km(2), an average glacier thickness change rate of -0.24 +/- 0.22 m/a was derived. This result agrees well with the result based on satellite laser altimetry measurements reported earlier (-0.31 +/- 0.41 m/a). With temporal synchronization, a fine spatial resolution and wide coverage, our measurements are able to reveal abundant glacier change features and dependencies in the CTS. Firstly, the lower mountains have seen a more severe glacier decline, and the glaciers facing the prevailing wind (westerlies) have experienced a greater decline because of the stronger evaporation. Furthermore, those glaciers lying along the extremely high Meridian mountain range have obviously gained mass in their upper reaches, because the air current from the west is blocked and lifted by the Meridian mountain range. Secondly, for the entire glacier body, the theoretical hyperbolic dependence between debris thickness and ice decline was very difficult to establish. Some huge glaciers covered by heavy debris have still experienced a severe decline. However, even though the heavy debris did not prevent the ablation, its attenuating effects were considerable. Thirdly, for the glaciers that surged before 2000, the mass gain in the restoring zones has not been enough to cover the mass loss in ablation zones. Some large glaciers surged again during 2000-2012; however, with much lower magnitudes than in previous surges. In general, the surge glaciers have experienced a greater decline than the non-surge glaciers. Fourthly, due to the ice front calving and subglacial thermal erosion, glaciers connected to proglacial lakes have receded and thinned much more rapidly than the land-terminated glaciers. Overall, the glaciers in the CTS are more stable than those in other parts of the Tien Shan. However, the glacier state there is still alarming. A moderate average thinning rate was derived because the drastic thinning in the ablation zones was balanced by the slight thinning in the broad accumulation zones. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

"Active appearance models (AAMs) are one of the most popular and well-established techniques for modeling deformable objects in computer vision. In this paper, we study the problem of fitting AAMs using compositional gradient descent (CGD) algorithms. We present a unified and complete view of these algorithms and classify them with respect to three main characteristics: (i) cost function; (ii) type of composition; and (iii) optimization method. Furthermore, we extend the previous view by: (a) proposing a novel Bayesian cost function that can be interpreted as a general probabilistic formulation of the well-known project-out loss; (b) introducing two new types of composition, asymmetric and bidirectional, that combine the gradients of both image and appearance model to derive better convergent and more robust CGD algorithms; and (c) providing new valuable insights into existent CGD algorithms by reinterpreting them as direct applications of the Schur complement and the Wiberg method. Finally, in order to encourage open research and facilitate future comparisons with our work, we make the implementation of the algorithms studied in this paper publicly available as part of the Menpo Project (http://www.menpo.org).

"Although motion estimation (ME) approaches for fluid flows have been widely studied in computer vision domain, most existing ME algorithms cannot accurately deal with regions with both slight and drastic brightness changes. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel data structure called brightness distribution matrix (BDM) which can be used to accurately model regional brightness. Based on our proposed consistency constraints and energy function, we can obtain motion vectors from image sequences with high accuracy. Since the BDM-based ME approach requires a large number of computations when dealing with complex fluid scenarios, to reduce the overall ME time, a parallelized version of our approach is developed based on graphics processing unit (GPU). Experimental results show that our GPU-based approach not only can be used to improve the ME quality for complex fluid images, but also can reduce the overall ME processing time (up to 7.06 times improvement).

"A liquid metal electric motor including a pair of concentric ring electrodes, permanent magnet and electrolyte solution is demonstrated. A liquid metal galinstan sphere, along with a NaOH solution, is stimulated to rotate centrifugally around the central electrode and the rotating speed increases with the voltage. The NaOH solution serves to rapidly remove the oxide on the liquid metal surface, reduce the motion friction and provide impetus to the liquid metal. As the mass of the liquid metal is increased to 12.16 g to form a kidney-like body, its rotating speed appears more controllable and the effect of the electrolytic action in the NaOH solution becomes weak in the range of 0-1.82 V. As the mass of the liquid metal is increased to 18.20 g to form a circular ring-shaped body, the ideal voltage range for controlling the rotating motion of the liquid metal is 0-0.81 V. The metal fluid rotates at a speed of 1.9 r.p.m., even at an extremely low voltage of 0.03 V. The liquid metal electric motor established here can find important applications in chip cooling, liquid metal pumps, material mixing, soft machine realization, etc.

"A robust and efficient object tracking algorithm is required in a variety of computer vision applications. Although various modern trackers have impressive performance, some challenges such as occlusion and target scale variation are still intractable, especially in the complex scenarios. This paper proposes a robust scale adaptive tracking algorithm to predict target scale by a sequential Monte Carlo method and determine the target location by the correlation filter simultaneously. By analyzing the response map of the target region, the completeness of the target can be measured by the peak-to-sidelobe rate (PSR), i.e., the lower the PSR, the more likely the target is being occluded. A strict template update strategy is designed to accommodate the appearance change and avoid template corruption. If the occlusion occurs, a retained scheme is allowed and the tracker refrains from drifting away. Additionally, the feature integration is incorporated to guarantee the robustness of the proposed approach. The experimental results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art trackers in terms of both the distance precision and overlap precision on the publicly available TB-50 dataset.

"A memristor is a resistor with memory that exhibits a pinched hysteretic relationship in cyclic voltammetry. Recently, we have found memristors in the electrical circuitry of plants and seeds. There are no publications in literature about the possible existence of memristors and electrical differentiators in fruits. Here we found that the electrostimulation of Golden Delicious or Arkansas Black apple fruits by bipolar periodic waves induces hysteresis loops with pinched points in cyclic voltammograms at low frequencies between 0.1 MHz and 1 MHz. At high frequencies of 1 kHz, the pinched hysteresis loop transforms to a non-pinched hysteresis loop instead of a single line I= V / R for ideal memristors because the amplitude of electrical current depends on capacitance of a fruit's tissue and electrodes, frequency and direction of scanning. Electrostimulation of electrical circuits in apple fruits by periodic voltage waves also induces electrotonic potential propagation due to cell-to-cell electrical coupling with electrical differentiators. A differentiator is an electrical circuit in which the output of the circuit is approximately directly proportional to the rate of change of the input. The information gained from electrostimulation can be used to elucidate and to observe electrochemical and electrophysiological properties of electrical circuits in fruits. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"A differential-hybrid charge sensitive preamplifier (CSP) was designed by taking a monolithic dual N-Channel Junction Field-effect Transistor (JFET) and a high-speed, low-noise, operational amplifier as the core parts. Input-stage of the circuit employs low-noise differential dual JFET, which ensures high input impedance and low noise. The differential dual transistor makes the quiescent point of the first-stage differential output stable, which is convenient for connecting with the post stage high-speed operational amplifier. Broadband could be amplified by connecting to the double differential dual transistors through the folded cascode-bootstrap. The amplifying circuit which replaces the interstage and post stage discrete components of a traditional CSP with integrated operational amplifier is simpler and more reliable. It simplifies the design of the quiescent point, gives full play to advantages of releasing large open-loop gain, and improves charge-voltage conversion gain stability. Particularly, the charge-voltage conversion gain is larger under a smaller feedback capacitor, thus enabling to gain better signal-noise ratio. The designed CSP was tested, reporting 3.3 x10(13) V/C charge sensitivity, about 90 ns rise time of signals, 35:1 signal-noise ratio to gamma-rays of Cs-137 (662 keV) and a 0.023 fC/pF noise slope.

In this study, the master logic diagram (i.e., an analysis for identifying the differences between an H-SIT and a safety injection pump) and an accident case classification were used to determine the parameters of the H-SIT operation. The conditions that require the use of an H-SIT were determined using a decision-making process. The proper timing for using an H-SIT was also analyzed by using the Multi-dimensional Analysis of Reactor Safety (MARS) 1.3 code (Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea). The operation strategy analysis indicates that a H-SIT can mitigate five types of failure: (1) failure of the safety injection pump, (2) failure of the passive auxiliary feedwater system, (3) failure of the depressurization system, (4) failure of the shutdown cooling pump (SCP), and (5) failure of the recirculation system. The results of the MARS code demonstrate that the time allowed for recovery can be extended when using an H-SIT, compared with the same situation in which an H-SIT is not used.

"A hidden Markov model (HMM) consisting of a controlled Markov chain and a binary output is considered. The binary output reports the occurrence of a certain state (versus any other state) in the Markov chain. The transition matrix of the Markov chain depends on a control vector which is to be chosen to minimize a discounted infinite-horizon cost function. The information provided for decision making is the entire history of the binary output which presents an incomplete knowledge of the Markov chain and, as a consequence, leads to a stochastic control problem with partial observations. The solution to such a problem is a control policy consisting of two components: an estimator to derive the posterior probability distribution of the Markov chain from the observation set, and a nonlinear control law to map this estimate into the control vector. This paper introduces a nonlinear state-space representation for the estimator, develops analytical expressions for the control law, and presents numerical methods for efficient computation of the optimal control. Application of these results to optimal management of a class of inventory systems is discussed, and the performance of optimal control for this application is examined by numerical simulations.

Soybean production involves large amounts of water and fertiliser that act as sources of contamination with potentially negative impacts on adjacent water bodies.

The aim of this study was to understand potential impacts on environmental sustainability of agricultural intensification close to a protected forest area of the Amazon under climate change. We carried out a WFA to calculate the water footprint (WF) related to soybean production, Glycine max, to understand the sustainability of the WF in the Tapajos river basin, a region in the Brazilian Amazon with large expansion and intensification of soybean. Based on global datasets, environmental hotspots potentially unsustainable WF areas were identified and spatially plotted in both baseline scenario (2010) and projection into 2050 through the use of a land-use change scenario that includes climate change effects. Results show green and grey WF values in 2050 increased by 304%, and 268%, respectively. More than one-third of the watersheds doubled their grey WF in 2050. Soybean production in 2010 lies within sustainability I imits.

The kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), which only preserves the global Euclidean structure of data, and the kernel locality preserving projections (KLPP), which only preserves the local neighborhood structure of data, are unified in the KGLPP framework. KPCA and KLPP can be easily derived from KGLPP by choosing some particular values of parameters. As a result, KGLPP is more powerful than KPCA and KLPP in capturing useful data characteristics. A KGLPP-based monitoring method is proposed for nonlinear processes. T-2 and SPE statistics are constructed in the feature space for fault detection. Case studies in a nonlinear system and in the Tennessee Eastman process demonstrate that the KGLPP-based method significantly outperforms KPCA, KLPP and GLPP-based methods, in terms of higher fault detection rates and better fault sensitivity.

"A platform for electrochemical transduction suitable for miniaturised point-of-care diagnostic solutions with intuitive optical read-out was designed. Electrolytic current from electrochemical cell was transduced into the glow of a light-emitting diode. Its performance was optimised and several variants of transducing circuitry were tested. The circuit comprising field-effect transistor (FET) exhibited the sought abilities - absolute simplicity and high and tuneable sensitivity of the transducing device. Limit-of-detection, i.e. a signal readable by naked-eye without any additional instrumentation was as low as 4 mu M for direct assay of H2O2. The whole transducing system employing FET consisted of 4 off-the-shelf components and its price reached <0.3 (sic) even at small-scale experimental production. As our system was rather suitable for the semiquantitative ""YES/NO"" applications due to the steep response curve, an alternative circuitry for widening the linear range was also probed. Finally, rather higher initial voltage that was required in the electrochemical cell for FET-based transducer lead us to design a further simplified and more variable circuit employing the operational amplifier.

"A full-scale test embankment was constructed on a soft deposit (S-u < 20 kPa) improved by geotextile-encased granular columns to assess its serviceability performance for a nearby stockyard foundation. The behaviour of the improved foundation was monitored by means of instrumentation with respect to surface settlements, excess pore pressures, total vertical stresses acting on the top of the encased column and surrounding soft soil as well as geotextile radial deformation. Two-dimensional finite-element analysis was performed using an axi-symmetric unit cell, and then the results were compared with field measurements. It was observed that the soil arching progressed during post-construction due to a decrease in apparent stiffness of soft clay from quasi undrained to drained stiffness. Furthermore, there was a difference in settlement between the top of the encased column and the surrounding soft soil, midpoint between the columns, which increased during both construction and consolidation stages. A measured relation was also found to correlate the geotextile expansion with the maximum settlement occurring below the embankment.

"A series of experiments were conducted in a flume to study bed-load transport. The motion of bed-load particles was captured by a series of images taken by a high-speed camera.A novelparticle motion tracking method was developed to automatically detect all the moving particles and calculate the instantaneous particle velocities. The instantaneous bed load transport rate was calculated based on particle velocity and the volume of moving particles. To verify this method, bed load transport rate based on the image processing technique was compared to the manually measured ones as well as data from other experiments. Results showed that the new technique made it possible to quantify the spatial and temporal variations of bed load transport rate at the individual particle scale.

"A novel series of feruloyl-donepezil hybrid compounds were designed, synthesized and evaluated as multitarget drug candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In vitro results revealed potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity for some of these compounds and all of them showed moderate antioxidant properties. Compounds 12a, 12b and 12c were the most potent AChE inhibitors, highlighting 12a with IC50 = 0.46 mu M. In addition, these three most promising compounds exhibited significant in vivo anti-inflammatory activity in the mice paw edema, pleurisy and formalin-induced hyperalgesy models, in vitro metal chelator activity for Cu2+ and Fe2+, and neuroprotection of human neuronal cells against oxidative damage. Molecular docking studies corroborated the in vitro inhibitory mode of interaction of these active compounds on AChE. Based on these data, compound 12a was identified as a novel promising drug prototype candidate for the treatment of AD with innovative structural feature and multitarget effects.

"113 parents of children aged 5-13 with ASD completed online surveys assessing co-parenting quality, parenting stress, and child feeding challenges. Results indicated that food selectivity was both the most frequently reported type of challenging feeding behavior and the most often reported as problematic but was also the only type of challenging feeding behavior that was not associated with parenting stress. Greater parenting stress was reported when co-parenting agreement and support were lower. Child disruptive behavior at mealtime was the only feeding challenge associated with quality of co-parenting. This paper points to the importance of addressing feeding challenges in addition to selectivity, such as disruptive mealtime behaviors, and doing so within the context of the family and home environment.

"An ionic polymer-metal composite (abbreviated IPMC) is a smart material consisting of two layers of noble metal and an ion-conducting layer between them. Smart materials are generally capable of actuating and sensing. Mechanical deformation of the IPMC beam produces an electrical potential difference (in the order of mV) proportional to the deformation of the ion-conducting layer. In this paper, the sensing capabilities of IPMC samples were investigated. The composites were manufactured in the form of thin plates (0.3 mm) cut into rectangular samples. The aging aspect of the IPMC was considered: the comparison between previously used and newly-acquired samples to study fatigue parameters on sensing response was researched. The response of the samples in various frequencies was tested for each sample and for two mechanically and electrically coupled samples. Finally, certain applications of IPMC are proposed, based on these measurements. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Across the globe, economic fluctuations have taken their toll on both organizations and employees, particularly during sustained recessions. Surprisingly, little research, however, has directly investigated the effects of recessions on employees. As such, the goal of the current study was to investigate the effects of specific recession-related stressors on employee outcomes (strain and satisfaction). We investigated an archival data set of 7666 individuals collected as part of the Workplace Employment Relations Study for relations among recession-related stressors with strain and job satisfaction variables. We found that recession-related stressors were significantly related to both strain and satisfaction. More specifically, certain recession-related stressors (e.g. increased workload and reorganization of work) were more strongly related to strain and satisfaction than others. These results imply the need for greater attention to stress management strategies aimed at helping both employees and their organizations cope with the human costs of economic recessions.

"Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is traditionally sown in field without ridge and furrow, in rain-fed semi-arid areas of Northwest China, and forage yields are normally low because of drought, water loss and soil erosion. A field study was conducted to determine (I) Monthly runoff efficiency and threshold rainfall for different ridge widths (30,45 and 60 cm), and mulched with different materials (common plastic film, bio-degradable mulching film and manually compacted soil); and (2) the effects of different ridge-furrow ratios (30:60,45:60 and 60:60) and ridge-mulching materials on soil water storage, topsoil temperature, forage yields, and water use efficiency (WUE) of Alfalfa in ridge-furrow rainwater harvesting (RFRWH) system, during 2 consecutive years: 2012 and 2013. Average monthly runoff efficiency over these 2 years, was 16%, 18%, 19%, 65%, 71%, 77%, 70%, 72% and 79% for SR30, SR45, SR60, BMR30, BMR45, BMR50, CMR30, CMR45 and CMR60 (SR, BMR and CMR were ridges with manually compacted soil, mulched with bio-degradable mulch film and common plastic film, respectively, and subscripts 30,45 and 60 refer to ridge widths (cm) all with 60 6-11 furrow width), respectively. For the same treatments, threshold rainfall was 4.3, 4.3, 4.2, 3.0, 2.9, 2.8, 2.9, 2.9 and 2.8 mm. The field experiment showed that ridge mulching materials and ridge widths had distinct effects on topsoil temperature at ridge tops, but not at furrow bottoms. Soil water storage in 140 cm soil depth at furrow bottoms increased with increasing ridge width and in the order of CMR approximate to BMR>SR>FP. Average annual total forage yields for FP, SR, BMR and CMR were 6276, 5642, 7563 and 7817 kg ha(-1), respectively, over 2 years. The total precipitation in both years was higher than average of rainfall, leading to significant decreases of forage yields for SR, and significant increases of forage yields for BMR and CMR. Compared with FP, average forage yields decreased by 3%, 10% and 17% for SR30, SR45 and SR60, and increased by 27%, 21%, 13%, 32%, 26% and 16% for BMR30, BMR45, BMR50, CMR30, CMR45 and CMR60, respectively, over 2 years. WUE for SR, BMR and CMR was 1.69, 1.74 and 1.74 times greater than that for FP over 2 years, and increased with decreasing ridge width. Optimum furrow width was 35-36 cm for CMR and BMR in the RFRWH system with 60 cm width furrows for Alfalfa production in this region. Future study is needed to investigate optimum ridge-furrow ratio and suitable ridge-mulching material for achieving the best environmental and economic benefit under different climatic conditions, soil types and plant species, and using bio-degradable mulching materials.

"A test oracle determines whether a test execution reveals a fault, often by comparing the observed program output to the expected output. This is not always practical, for example when a program's input-output relation is complex and difficult to capture formally. Metamorphic testing provides an alternative, where correctness is not determined by checking an individual concrete output, but by applying a transformation to a test input and observing how the program output ""morphs"" into a different one as a result. Since the introduction of such metamorphic relations in 1998, many contributions on metamorphic testing have been made, and the technique has seen successful applications in a variety of domains, ranging from web services to computer graphics. This article provides a comprehensive survey on metamorphic testing: It summarises the research results and application areas, and analyses common practice in empirical studies of metamorphic testing as well as the main open challenges.

"5G mobile networks are promising to offer mobile users unrivaled experiences with infinite networking capability at any period and from anywhere. However, it appears unnecessary and impractical for the customers and servers to be connected permanently in wireless networks because battery life is a bottleneck in such kind of networks. Therefore, the authorized entity needs to delegate its right to others in order to ensure the services available. This paper aims to address the issue of delegating authentication in 5G networks by proposing a new proxy signature scheme with efficient proxy signing operations. Concretely, we present a new and efficient proxy signature algorithm whose unforgeability can be reduced to the well-known discrete logarithm assumption. In the proposal, the original signer delegates his signing right by signing an exposure-free chameleon hash value on the warrant, and the proxy signer can generate a proxy signature on a message only by calculating a chameleon hash collision between the warrant and the message. This approach is computationally cost-effective for the proxy signer. Further analysis of the new scheme demonstrates that it offers the desirable properties of delegation of signing sights.

"A simple synthetic-wavelength self-mixing interferometer is proposed for precision displacement measurement. Choosing the frequency difference of the orthogonally polarized dual frequency He-Ne laser appropriately, we introduce synthetic wavelength theory into self-mixing interference principle and demonstrate a feasible optical configuration by simply adjusting the optical design of self-mixing interferometer. The phase difference between the two orthogonally polarized feedback fringes is observed, and the tiny displacement of the object can be measured through the phase change of the synthetic signal. Since the virtual synthetic wavelength is 106 times larger than the operating wavelength, sub-nanometer displacement of the object can be obtained in millimeter criterion measurement without modulation, demodulation and complicated electrical circuits. Experimental results verifies the synthetic wavelength self-mixing interferometer's ability of measuring nanoscale displacement, which provides a potential approach for contactless precision displacement measurement in a number of scientific and industrial applications.

"An experimental program of large-scale direct shear tests has indicated that shear displacement of a gravel drainage layer and nonwoven geotextile protection layer over a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane under moderate to high normal stress conditions can cause much greater damage to the geomembrane than static pressure alone. Essentially, no damage was observed at low normal stress. The greatest damage occurred at high normal stress (1,389 kPa) using a lightweight geotextile (335 g/m(2)) and yielded an average of 31 holes/m(2), with a maximum hole size of 29 mm. Surprisingly, geomembrane damage measured using a lightweight geotextile was greater than that measured using no geotextile due to a change in failure surface location. For the same conditions, shear-induced damage was slightly less for a geomembrane placed on a compacted sand subgrade than on a compacted clay subgrade. Interface shear strength increased significantly with decreasing geotextile mass/area due to greater out-of-plane deformation of the geomembrane. The findings suggest that the placement of a gravel drainage layer on top of a HDPE geomembrane, even with a protection nonwoven geotextile, should be viewed with caution for landfill bottom liner systems and other moderate-to high-stress applications. If there is a reasonable expectation for interface shear displacement, project-specific direct shear tests should be conducted to determine the potential for shear-induced geomembrane damage. Recommendations are provided for the performance of such tests and for design options when damage mitigation is necessary. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

"Agent-based simulations are increasingly popular in exploring and understanding cellular systems, but the natural complexity of these systems and the desire to grasp different modelling levels demand cost-effective simulation strategies and tools. In this context, the present paper introduces novel sequential and distributed approaches for the three-dimensional agent-based simulation of individual molecules in cellular events. These approaches are able to describe the dimensions and position of the molecules with high accuracy and thus, study the critical effect of spatial distribution on cellular events. Moreover, two of the approaches allow multi-thread high performance simulations, distributing the three-dimensional model in a platform independent and computationally efficient way. Evaluation addressed the reproduction of molecular scenarios and different scalability aspects of agent creation and agent interaction. The three approaches simulate common biophysical and biochemical laws faithfully. The distributed approaches show improved performance when dealing with large agent populations while the sequential approach is better suited for small to medium size agent populations. Overall, the main new contribution of the approaches is the ability to simulate three-dimensional agent-based models at the molecular level with reduced implementation effort and moderate-level computational capacity. Since these approaches have a generic design, they have the major potential of being used in any event-driven agent-based tool. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"A new technique called geotextile mattress with floating curtain (GMFC) may be an advisable alternative countermeasure against seabed erosion, since it can allow deposited sediment dunes to form naturally at upstream and downstream sides of GMFC when installed in erosive flow. However, cyclic loading of wave actions can lead to liquefaction of the seabed under the mattress, reducing the maximum friction resistance of the mattress, even leading to instability of the GMFC structure. Thus, in this study a series of physical model tests in a rectangular flume were carried out to investigate the behavior of a single GMFC and the hydrodynamic environment around GMFC subjected to wave loading. The wave force on seabed was recorded by pressure gauges installed on the flume bed. Experimental results indicated that some area of the unmovable bed around GMFC suffered much higher hydrodynamic pressure under the wave action. The areas directly facing the bottom openings of GMFC are more prone to bear higher cyclic force of wave actions. Moreover, the results also illustrated that the highest cyclic force of wave actions on the seabed appears at a distance of the mattress-curtain height to the GMFC centerline. The parametric study indicated that the opening ratio has a significant impact on the wave force properties.

"A frequency response approach is taken to model unsteady aerodynamics resulting from plunging oscillations of an airfoil. The oscillations range covers high angles of attack (up to 65 degrees) and reduced frequencies (up to 0.95) with particular attention to the range of flow nonlinearities over which lift enhancement is observed. Experiments were performed in a wind tunnel on an airfoil section at a Reynolds number of 80,000. Airfoil acceleration and lift force data were used to determine the frequency response functions between the measured unsteady lift and the quasi-steady lift. The results show enhanced lift amplitude over the stall regime at a reduced frequency of 0.7. The flow dynamics associated with this observation were identified from water tunnel experiments. Particular attention is paid to the flow separation and consequent formation and convection of the leading edge vortex. An optimization-based system identification approach is performed to represent the unsteady lift by a fourth-order dynamical system. This representation is suitable for sensitivity, dynamics and control analyses especially for applications where unsteady aerodynamics can be exploited for the purpose of lift enhancement.

Therefore, the CQD scheme is analyzed under the influence of damping, dephasing and depolarizing non-Markovian channels, and subsequently, the effect of these non-Markovian channels on the other schemes of secure quantum communication is deduced from the results obtained for CQD. The damped non-Markovian channel causes a periodic revival in the fidelity, while fidelity is observed to be sustained under the influence of the dephasing non-Markovian channel.

"AIM To determine the placebo response rate associated with different types of placebo interventions used in psychological intervention studies for irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS Randomized controlled trials comparing psychological interventions (stress management/relaxation therapy (cognitive) behavioral therapy, short-term psychodynamic therapy, and hypnotherapy) for the treatment of adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnosed with the Manning or Rome criteria with an adequate placebo control treatment and reporting data on IBS symptom severity were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases. Full-text articles that were written in English and published between 1966 and February 2016 in peer-reviewed journals were selected for the present review. Placebo interventions were considered to be adequate if the number of sessions and the amount of time spent with the therapist were the same as in the active treatment. The placebo response rate (PRR) was computed for IBS symptom severity (primary outcome measure) as well as for anxiety, depression and quality of life (secondary outcome measures). RESULTS Six studies, with a total of 555 patients met the inclusion criteria. Four studies used an educational intervention, whereas two studies used a form of supportive therapy as the placebo intervention. The PRR for IBS symptom severity ranged from 25% to 59%, with a pooled mean of 41.4%. The relative PRR for the secondary outcome measures ranged from 0% to 267% for anxiety, 6% to 52% for depression 20% to 125% for quality of life. The PRR associated with pharmacological treatments, treatment with dietary bran and complementary medicine ranged from 37.5% to 47%. Contrary to our expectations, the PRR in studies on psychological interventions was comparable to that in studies on pharmacological, dietary and alternative medical interventions. CONCLUSION The PRR is probably determined to a larger extent by patient-related factors, such as expectations and desire for the treatment to be effective, than the content of the placebo intervention.

"An approach to performing linguistic summaries of graph datasets, with particular focus on usage of ontologies is presented in this paper. This well-known mining technique is based on fuzzy set theory, which is used to model natural language words (e.g. 'many', 'tall'), and in result-generates natural-like sentences describing the data. Although intensely developed, before our work this method has been applied only to relational databases, while more and more data is available in graph model. A special case of such graph datasets is the Semantic Web, in which ontologies provide meaning, therefore enabling advanced machine learning. In our paper we analyze the problem of generating linguistic summaries for a graph data case (for which the method cannot be directly applied), with associated ontologies. The key element of ontologies are concept hierarchies, which are the core of our work. Firstly, due to heterogeneity and lack of schema we propose to use an ontological concept (including all sub-concepts in hierarchy) as a subject for summaries, and extract their attributes (neighboring vertexes).

"Analytical solutions of the van der Waals normal form for fluidized granular media have been done to study the phase separation phenomenon by using two different exact methods. The Painleve analysis is discussed to illustrate the integrability of the model equation. An auto-Backlund transformation is presented via the truncated expansion and symbolic computation. The results show that the exact solutions of the model introduce solitary waves of different types. The solutions of the hydrodynamic model and the van der Waals equation exhibit a behavior similar to the one observed in molecular dynamic simulations such that two pairs of shock and rarefaction waves appear and move away, giving rise to the bubbles. The dispersion properties and the relation between group and phase velocities of the model equation are studied using the plane wave assumption. The diagrams are drawn to illustrate the physical properties of the exact solutions, and indicate their stability and bifurcation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Ambient Intelligence (AmI) systems are collections of interconnected services that use heterogeneous devices to integrate smoothly in the everyday environment of their users. Engineering these systems is a challenging task, where designers need to deal with issues such as information management, users' profiles and activities, privacy, distribution, or continuous availability. The application of the multi-agent paradigm to develop these systems has been one of the most active lines of research in the area. Its abstractions of intentional and social agents are useful to analyze AmI systems with an integrated view of people and the services working for them. Moreover, this paradigm already offers solutions to deal with many of the key aspects of AmI. This special issue highlights some state-of-the-art works in this line.

"A 3D finite element (FE) model for the Sutong cable-stayed bridge (SCB) is established based on ANSYS. The dynamic characteristics of the bridge are analyzed using a subspace iteration method. Based on recorded wind data, the measured spectra expression is presented using the nonlinear least-squares regression method. Turbulent winds at the bridge site are simulated based on the spectral representation method and the FFT technique. The influence of some key structural parameters and measures on the dynamic characteristics of the bridge are investigated. These parameters include dead load intensity, as well as vertical, lateral and torsional stiffness of the steel box girder. In addition, the influence of elastic stiffness of the connection device employed between the towers and the girder on the vibration mode of the steel box girder is investigated. The analysis shows that all of the vertical, lateral and torsional buffeting displacement responses reduce gradually as the dead load intensity increases. The dynamic characteristics and the structural buffeting displacement response of the SCB are only slightly affected by the vertical and torsional stiffness of the steel box girder, and the lateral and torsional buffeting displacement responses reduce gradually as the lateral stiffness increases. These results provide a reference for dynamic analysis and design of super-long-span cable-stayed bridges.

But the problem emerges when trying to convert a space into an ambient intelligence environment or to modify one that already exists. This is where a simulator could help to arrive to an optimal set up without the need of expending money installing the required devices until we are sure we have achieved the desired configuration. In this paper we propose the architecture for the integration of social simulation with network simulation in order to create a whole ambient intelligence environment simulator.

"Active Contour Models (ACM) have been widely used for segmentation in many computer vision applications. These models are defined by an energy functional attached to an initial curve that evolves under some constraints to extract desired objects in the image. New models are proposed, and existing techniques are investigated and improved in different domains. Among these ACM, Balloon ACM is an edge-based model that adds a normal force as constraint making the curve to have more dynamic behaviors and more effectiveness in detecting objects boundary. However, some problems have been pointed out including segmentation of complex shape and high runtime processing. In this paper, we develop a new method -called Fast Adaptive Balloon (FAB)-sufficient to segment complex shape with lower computational complexity. The proposed definition for balloon force achieves satisfactory segmentation performance compared with other ACMs using both synthetic and medical images in two dimension. The results demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness in segmentation besides the convergence speed.

"A closed loop frequency tracking electronics circuit has been proposed for the measurement of pressure and temperature using a newly developed Langasite (LGS) piezo crystals. The ambient force and heat applied on the LGS crystal produces the shift in its resonant frequency. The proposed closed loop electronics tracks the shift in resonant frequency and measures the pressure and temperature by relating to the difference in frequency shift. The steady state oscillation condition of the resonator circuit is analytically derived and experimentally verified. The experimental setup consists of an operational amplifier based resonator circuit connected to the langasite piezo crystal placed between a double side diametric forces loading device with temperature controller bath. The diametric force applied on the LGS crystal produces the frequency shift in its fundamental mechanical vibration mode (Cmode). Similarly, the change in temperature produces the frequency shift in its second mechanical vibrational mode (Bmode). The frequency shifts are measured using two separate closed loop resonator electronics for two different measurand. Whenever the force on the LGS crystal is changed by the external unknown pressure, an additional intrinsic material property change is added to the piezo and changes the fundamental oscillating resonant frequency. The closed loop resonant circuit tracks the change in resonance frequency and vibrates the LGS with the new resonance frequency depends on the external pressure strength. Similar procedure is followed for temperature induce frequency tracking measurement also. The proposed frequency tracking electronics concept is simple and it is found that it has high sensitivity and linearity.

In this study, an Ag-based plasmonic catalyst supported on mesoporous silica with isolated and tetrahedrally coordinated single-site Ti-oxide moieties, namely, Ag/Ti-SBA-15, was designed with the purpose of utilizing the broad spectral range of solar energy. The Ti-SBA-15 support allows the deposition of small Ag NPs with a narrow size distribution. The chemical structure, morphology, and optical properties of the prepared catalyst were characterized by techniques such as UV/Vis, FT extended X-ray absorption fine structure, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, field-emission SEM, TEM, and N-2 physisorption studies. The catalytic activity of Ag/Ti-SBA-15 in hydrogen production from ammonia borane by hydrolysis was significantly enhanced in comparison with Ag/SBA-15 without Ti-oxide moieties and Ag/TiO2/SBA-15 involving agglomerated TiO2, both in the dark and under light irradiation. Improved electron transfer under light irradiation caused by the creation of heterojunctions between Ag NPs and Ti-oxide moieties explains the results obtained in the present study.

This paper formulates the design into a multi-objective optimization problem, with lake circulation effects and operation cost as two objectives, and solves the optimization problem with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II. The lake flow pattern is modelled in FLUENT. The parallelization aims at multiple FLUENT instance runs, which is different from the FLUENT internal parallel solver. This approach: (1) proposes lake flow pattern metrics, i.e. weighted average water flow velocity, water volume percentage of low flow velocity, and variance of flow velocity, (2) defines user defined functions for boundary setting, objective and constraints calculation, and (3) parallels the execution of multiple FLUENT instances runs to significantly reduce the optimization wall-clock time.

"A new experimental, image-based methodology suitable to track the changes in orientation of non-spherical particles and their influence on the drag coefficient as they settle in fluids is presented. Given the fact that non spherical solids naturally develop variations in their angular orientation during the fall, none-intrusiveness of the technique of analysis is of paramount importance in order to preserve the particle/fluid interaction undisturbed. Three-dimensional quantitative data about the motion parameters is obtained through single-camera stereo vision whilst qualitative visualizations of the adjacent fluid patterns are achieved with Schlieren photography. The methodology was validated by comparing the magnitudes of the drag coefficient of a set of spherical particles at terminal velocity conditions against those estimated from drag correlations published in the literature. A noteworthy similarity was attained. During the fall of non-spherical solids, once the particle Reynolds number approximated 163 for disks, and 240 for cylinders, or exceeded those values, secondary motions composed by regular oscillations and tumbling were present They altered the angular orientation of the particles with respect to the main motion direction and caused complete turbulent patterns in the surrounding flow, therefore affecting the instantaneous projected area, drag force, and coefficient of resistance. The impact of the changes in angular orientation onto the drag coefficient was shown graphically as a means for reinforcing existing numerical approaches, however, an explicit relation between both variables could not be observed.

"A novel depth from defocus (DFD) measurement system is presented, where the extension of the measurement range is performed using an emergent technology based on liquid lenses. A suitable set of different focal lengths, obtained by properly changing the liquid lens supply voltage, provides multiple camera settings without duplicating the system elements or using moving parts. A simple and compact setup, with a single camera/illuminator coaxial assembly, is obtained. The measurement is based on an active DFD technique using modulation measurement profilometry for the estimation of the contrast at each image point as a function of the depth range. Two different measurement methods are proposed, both based on a combination of multiple contrast curves, each derived at a specific focal length. In the first method (intensity contrast method), the depth information is recovered directly from the contrast curves, whereas in the second (differential contrast method), the depth is measured using contrast curve pairs. We obtained a measurement sigma(0) of 0.55 mm over a depth range of 60 mm with the intensity contrast method (0.92% of the total range) and an sigma(0) of 0.76 mm over a depth range of 135 mm with the differential contrast method (0.56% of the total range).

Scores varied from a minimum DISCERN score of 18 to a maximum of 68 [ mean +/- SD, 42.2 +/- 10.7; median = 41.5, interquartile range, interquartile range (IQR) = 15.8] and a minimum score of HONcode of 0.14 and a maximum of 0.95 (mean +/- SD, 0.16 +/- 0.19; median = 0.45, IQR = 0.29). Most of these websites were reviewed in 2014 and 2015 (n = 51). The creators of these websites were: universities and research centers (n = 25, 30%), foundations and associations (n = 15, 18%), commercial and pharmaceutical companies (n = 25, 30%), charities and volunteer work (n = 9, 10%), and non-university educational bodies (n = 10, 12%). The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level readability score (mean +/- SD) was 11.9 +/- 2.4 and the Coleman-Liau Readability Index score was 12.6 +/- 1.5. Significant correlation was found between the two readability scores (R-2 = 0.509, p = 0.001). The overall agreement between evaluators measured by Cohen kappa coefficient was in the range of 0.804-0.876; rated as ""Good"". CONCLUSION The DISCERN and the HONcode scores of websites varied and the readability levels of most websites were above the public readability level. The study highlights the areas that need further improvement and development in patient education online materials about IBD.

"A fundamental challenge in digital control arises when the controlled plant is subjected to a fast disturbance dynamics but is only equipped with a relatively slow sensor. Such intrinsic difficulties are, however, commonly encountered in many novel applications such as laser- and electron-beam-based additive manufacturing, human-machine interaction, etc. This paper provides a discrete-time regulation scheme for exact sampled-data rejection of disturbances beyond Nyquist frequency. By introducing a model-based multirate predictor and a forward-model disturbance observer, we show that the inter sample disturbances can be fully attenuated despite the limitations in sampling and sensing. The proposed control scheme offers several advantages in stability assurance and lucid design intuitions. Verification of the algorithm is conducted on a motion control platform that shares the general characteristics in several advanced manufacturing systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Aggregation of proteins is a physiological process which contributes to the pathophysiology of several maladies including diabetes mellitus, Huntington's and Alzheimer's disease. In this study we have reported that aloe emodin (AE), an anthroquinone, which is one of the active components of the Aloe vera plant, acts as an inhibitor of hemoglobin (Hb) aggregation. Hb was thermally aggregated at 60 degrees C for four days as evident by increased thioflavin T and ANS fluorescence, shifted congo red absorbance, appearance of beta sheet structure, increase in turbidity and presence of oligomeric aggregates. Increasing concentration of AE partially reverses the aggregation of the model heme protein (hemoglobin). The maximum effect of AE was observed at 100 mu M followed by saturation at 125 mu M. The results were confirmed by UV-visible spectrometry, intrinsic fluorescence, ThT, ANS, congo red assay as well as transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These results were also supported by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and circular dichroism (CD) which shows the disappearance of beta sheet structure and appearance of a helices. This study will serve as baseline for translatory research and the development of AE based therapeutics for diseases attributed to protein aggregation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"A grid-connected inverter is indispensable for photovoltaic power generation and smart grid systems, and it must be designed for stable operation. The impedance method based on the Nyquist criterion is often utilized to analyze the stability of grid-connected inverter systems. The impedance method is based on the eigenvalues of the product of the inverter output admittance and the line impedance matrices in the frequency domain. However, the frequency characteristics have so far been derived only for inverters with analog control systems. A new frequency analysis method for inverters with digital control systems is proposed in this paper. First, a stability analysis example for a three-phase LCL-type inverter controlled digitally is shown and the results are compared and validated with those by simulation using a Saber simulator. Finally, they are also compared and validated with experimental results digitally controlled by a DSP-based system. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"Accessible summary Compassion focused therapy is a talking therapy. It helps people be kind to themselves. We do not know whether this therapy can help people with learning disabilities. Here, we talk about what happened when a man with a learning disability had the therapy. We hope that other people will use the therapy too. This will improve therapy for people with learning disabilities. Abstract Background Joe was referred to the Community Learning Disabilities Team (CLDT) for support around low mood and overeating. Initial formulation suggested compassion focused therapy (CFT) as an intervention. The evidence base for using CFT with people with learning disabilities is currently limited. Materials and Methods Adaptations were made to the CFT framework, accounting for Joe's learning disability. A case study design was used to investigate the effectiveness of intervention. Joe attended 13 sessions of assessment, formulation and intervention. Client feedback was incorporated to assess suitability of the CFT approach and adaptations made. Results and Conclusions Changes in scores on outcome measures were limited. However, findings from this exploratory study suggest that CFT can be meaningfully adapted for use within the field of learning disabilities. Implications for clinical practice and directions for future research are discussed.

"An important problem in the field of bioinformatics is to identify interactive effects among profiled variables for outcome prediction. In this paper, a logistic regression model with pairwise interactions among a set of binary covariates is considered. Modeling the structure of the interactions by a graph, our goal is to recover the interaction graph from independently identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples of the covariates and the outcome. When viewed as a feature selection problem, a simple quantity called influence is proposed as a measure of the marginal effects of the interaction terms on the outcome. For the case when the underlying interaction graph is known to be acyclic, it is shown that a simple algorithm that is based on a maximum-weight spanning tree with respect to the plug-in estimates of the influences not only has strong theoretical performance guarantees, but can also outperform generic feature selection algorithms for recovering the interaction graph from i.i.d. samples of the covariates and the outcome. Our results can also be extended to the model that includes both individual effects and pairwise interactions via the help of an auxiliary covariate.

"A longitudinal harvested rainwater quality monitoring study was undertaken at 6 sites within Selangor, Malaysia over a period of 8 months. Overall, harvested rainwater is of good quality, falling within the Malaysian recreational water quality Class BB standards with exceptions for pH (18/92), ammonia (1/92), phosphates (3/92), and total coliforms (8/92). A large number of samples tested positive for Escherichia coli (22/92), total coliforms (64/92) and Chromobacterium violaceum (7/92), showing that disinfection of harvested rainwater is mandatory prior to reuse. 2/37 harvested rainwater samples exceeded lead limits in Malaysian drinking water standards, showing that consuming rainwater without additional treatment may pose a health risk. Mixing harvested rainwater with groundwater resulted in higher phosphates and total coliforms. Rainwater collected during the wet seasons have higher concentrations of suspended solids, turbidity, and Escherichia coli than dry seasons due to the antecedent dry period. Last but not least, both principal component analysis and positive matrix factorisation were conducted on 37 samples to apportion pollutant sources in harvested rainwater. 7 principal components were identified, namely: industrial dust, steel, roadside dust, faeces, organic decay, fertilisers, and plumbing. The results from principal component analysis and positive matrix factorisation were in agreement, although the latter identified mains water top-up as an additional factor responsible for dissolved solids. Both techniques are effective at apportioning pollutant sources in harvested rainwater, and show that a rainwater harvesting system should be designed carefully to reduce contributions from steel, plumbing, organic decay, bird faeces, industrial dust and roadside dust.

"A hybrid power system uses many wind turbine generators (WTG) and solar photovoltaics (PV) in isolated small areas. However, the output power of these renewable sources is not constant and can diverge quickly, which has a serious effect on system frequency and the continuity of demand supply. In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a new frequency control scheme for a hybrid power system to ensure supplying a high-quality power in isolated areas. The proposed power system consists of a WTG, PV, aqua-electrolyzer (AE), fuel cell (FC), battery energy storage system (BESS), flywheel (FW) and diesel engine generator (DEG). Furthermore, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (EVs) are implemented at the customer side. A full-order observer is utilized to estimate the supply error. Then, the estimated supply error is considered in a frequency domain. The high-frequency component is reduced by BESS and FW; while the low-frequency component of supply error is mitigated using FC, EV and DEG. Two PI controllers are implemented in the proposed system to control the system frequency and reduce the supply error. The epsilon multi-objective genetic algorithm (epsilon-MOGA) is applied to optimize the controllers' parameters. The performance of the proposed control scheme is compared with that of recent well-established techniques, such as a PID controller tuned by the quasi-oppositional harmony search algorithm (QOHSA). The effectiveness and robustness of the hybrid power system are investigated under various operating conditions.

"A novel replacement for traditional wedgelocks used to mount PCB boards to cold plates is presented. This project began as part of a DARPA design competition to develop a field reversible thermal connector that could be repeatedly assembled and disassembled without the use of tools while providing constant thermal resistance. The team from UCLA was tasked with designing a new device to meet these constraints. The design meets the DARPA goals and significantly reduces the thermal resistance between the electrical board and the heat sink. The device consists of opposing aluminum wedges, driven by thermally actuated Nitinol springs, which slide against one another to provide the requisite locking force to hold a board in place and decrease contact resistance between the interfaces. These smart material springs push the wedges towards the outside of the device, elevating the upper surface and locking the board in place on the cold plate. The design increases the contact area between the components and decreases the thermal resistance relative to current devices. Experimental results have shown that the UCLA team has addressed the chief design problems posed by the REVCON program. Nitinol has been shown to be an effective material for use as a thermally actuated spring capable of repeatedly engaging and disengaging without the use of tools. The wedge locking force increases with rising temperature, enhancing its thermal performance. The UCLA design has been shown to out-perform similar sized current state of the art wedgelock designs in terms of thermal resistance. Reductions in thermal resistance of 30%-45% have been demonstrated and shown to be repeatable. Our prototype design increases the interfacial contact area which has a dramatic impact on performance. This means that higher power density electronics can be utilized or that more real estate will be made available on current computer boards in order to maintain current performance. Further, the use of thermally actuated leaf springs removes the need for mechanical force for installation allowing for less installation time.

"A dual channel satellite radio receiver that solves the deep fading effect specific to the automotive mobile environment by using antenna diversity was realized in a 0.18 mu m SiGe BiCMOS technology. The tuner power dissipation was reduced by using a second-zero-IF dual conversion architecture that requires a lower ADC sampling frequency and resolution. A single PLL drives the RF and IF mixers of both signal paths, resulting in a smaller die area and lower power dissipation. Providing a digital baseband I/Q output allows the implementation of the channel decode IC in a standard digital CMOS process, reducing the overall receiver cost. SDARS tuner performance includes: 5dB noise figure, 55dB image rejection, -100dBm input sensitivity, +15dBm IIP3 at min gain, 40/60dB RF/IF AGC range, 200mA current consumption from a 3.3V supply in dual channel operation and 26mm(2) die area.

"Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is strongly impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In several mouse models of AD, it was shown that adult -born neurons exhibit reduced survival and altered synaptic integration due to a severe lack of dendritic spines. In the present work, using the APPxPS1 mouse model of AD, we reveal that this reduced number of spines is concomitant of a marked deficit in their neuronal mitochondrial content. Remarkably, we show that targeting the overexpression of the pro -neural transcription factor Neurodl into APPxPS1 adult -born neurons restores not only their dendritic spine density, but also their mitochondrial content and the proportion of spines associated with mitochondria. Using primary neurons, a bona fide model of neuronal maturation, we identified that increases of mitochondrial respiration accompany the stimulating effect of Neurodl overexpression on dendritic growth and spine formation. Reciprocally, pharmacologically impairing mitochondria prevented Neurodl-dependent trophic effects. Thus, since overexpression of Neurodl into new neurons of APPxPS1 mice rescues spatial memory, our present data suggest that manipulating the mitochondrial system of adult -born hippocampal neurons provides neuronal plasticity to the AD brain. These findings open new avenues for far-reaching therapeutic implications towards neurodegenerative diseases associated with cognitive impairment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"As a new delivery mode, integrated project delivery (IPD) relies on highly trust-based collaboration among project parties. Thus, selecting the appropriate parties is important for successful IPD. Although traditional selection methods, which are primarily based on only the lowest tender price or multiple criteria other than price, can help select parties that can complete an integrated project, they are not completely suitable for IPD when trust and collaborative relationship among the project parties are considered. To improve upon this shortcoming of established methods, a new method based on the concept of an interorganizational transactive memory system (I-TMS) is established in this paper. The I-TMS drives group members to be mutually trusting and cooperatively integrate their professional knowledge, which reflects the idea of collaboration that underlies IPD. In this study, party selection for IPD was achieved via two processes. First, this study developed an I-TMS rating scale and conducted a questionnaire-based analysis to verify its reliability and validity quantitatively. Second, this study selected an appropriate combination from seven combinations of party candidates. In addition, this study analyzed the appropriate combination using social network analysis (SNA). The results suggest that project parties with a low I-TMS degree should engage in frequent interaction to foster mutual cognition and trust and improve team collaboration for IPD.

The influence of different monocarboxylic acids on the viscosities of polyesters and their 2K-PU films hardness was studied and it was found that MHPs prepared from lauric acid displayed the higher films hardness and lower viscosities. IR spectra of MHPs disclosed the ring-opening reaction between epsilon-caprolactone and hydroxyl groups occurred. H-1 NMR spectra demonstrated that the molecular structures of MHPs were irregular due to the multiplicity of reaction processes. The measured number-average molecular weights (M (n)) of MHPs were around 715-1854 g/mol with the PDI of 1.45-2.05. MHPs exhibited lower viscosities in the range of 3304-9060 mPa s at 100% solid contents and possessed lower intrinsic viscosities compared with linear polymers of similar molecular weight. The cured films of MHPs exhibited excellent impact resistance, adhesion, flexibility, and high hardness and displayed good thermal stability with 5% weight loss at 280A degrees C.

"A recommendation system for software engineering (RSSE) is a software application that provides information items estimated to be valuable for a software engineering task in a given context. Present the results of a systematic literature review to reveal the typical functionality offered by existing RSSEs, research gaps, and possible research directions. We evaluated 46 papers studying the benefits, the data requirements, the information and recommendation types, and the effort requirements of RSSE systems. We include papers describing tools that support source code related development published between 2003 and 2013. The results show that RSSEs typically visualize source code artifacts. They aim to improve system quality, make the development process more efficient and less expensive, lower developer's cognitive load, and help developers to make better decisions. They mainly support reuse actions and debugging, implementation, and maintenance phases. The majority of the systems are reactive. Unexploited opportunities lie in the development of recommender systems outside the source code domain. Furthermore, current RSSE systems use very limited context information and rely on simple models. Context-adapted and proactive behavior could improve the acceptance of RSSE systems in practice.

"A mental health trial is analyzed using a dose-response model, in which the number of sessions attended by the patients is deemed indicative of the dose of psychotherapeutic treatment. Here, the parameter of interest is the difference in causal treatment effects between the subpopulations that take part in different numbers of therapy sessions. For this data set, interactions between random treatment allocation and prognostic baseline variables provide the requisite instrumental variables. While the corresponding two-stage least squares (TSLS) estimator tends to have smaller bias than the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator; the TSLS suffers from larger variance. It is therefore appealing to combine the desirable properties of the OLS and TSLS estimators. Such a trade-off is achieved through an affine combination of these two estimators, using mean squared error as a criterion. This produces the semi-parametric Stein-like (SPSL) estimator as introduced by Judge and Mittelhammer (2004). The SPSL estimator is used in conjunction with multiple imputation with chained equations, to provide an estimator that can exploit all available information. Simulated data are also generated to illustrate the superiority of the SPSL estimator over its OLS and TSLS counterparts. A package entitled SteinIV implementing these methods has been made available through the R platform. (C) 2017 The Authors. Statistics in Medicine Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

"Affine equivalence classification of Boolean functions has significant applications in logic synthesis and cryptography. Previous studies for classification have been limited by the large set of Boolean functions and the complex operations on the affine group. Although there are many research on affine equivalence classification for parts of Boolean functions in recent years, there are very few results for the entire set of Boolean functions. The best existing result has been achieved by Harrison with 15768919 affine equivalence classes for 6-variable Boolean functions. This paper presents a concise formula for affine equivalence classification of the entire set of Boolean functions as well as a formula for affine classification of Boolean functions with distinct ON-set size respectively. The method outlined in this paper greatly simplifies the affine group's action by constructing an isomorphism mapping from the affine group to a permutation group. By this method, we can compute the affine equivalence classes for up to 10 variables. Experiment results indicate that our scheme for calculating the affine equivalence classes for more than 6 variables is a significant advancement over previous published methods.

The typical acoustic performances of this membrane-based silencer were experimentally identified using a transmission loss (TL) duct acoustic measurement system. It was found that the resonance peaks of this membrane-based silencer could be controlled by applying different external voltages, a maximum resonance frequency shift of 59.5 Hz for the resonance peaks was achieved which indicated that this membrane-based silencer could be adjusted to absorb the target noise without any addition mechanical part. Furthermore, the resonance shift and multiple resonances mechanisms using DEAs were proposed and discussed which was aiming to achieve multi-peaks noise reduction.

To determine the accuracy of this approach, we analyzed data from 10 double-blind, placebo-controlled, gluten-challenge trials, comprising 1312 adults. The studies varied in the duration of the challenge (range, 1 d to 6 wk), daily doses for the gluten challenge (range, 2-52 g; 3 studies administered <8 g/d), and composition of the placebo (gluten-free products, xylose, whey protein, rice, or corn starch containing fermentable carbohydrates). Most of the studies found gluten challenge to significantly increase symptom scores compared with placebo. However, only 38 of 231 NCGS patients (16%) showed gluten-specific symptoms. Furthermore, 40% of these subjects had a nocebo response (similar or increased symptoms in response to placebo). These findings reveal heterogeneity and potential methodology flaws among studies of gluten challenge, cast doubt on gluten as the culprit food component in most patients with presumptive NCGS, and highlight the importance of the nocebo effect in these types of studies.

The electrical properties of these samples were measured using ac impedance spectroscopy technique over a frequency range of 10 Hz to 13 MHz at several temperatures in the range of 323-673 K. The ac conductivity, dc conductivity, dielectric constant and loss factors were obtained from these measurements. Constant-phase elements (CPE) are used in equivalent electrical circuits for the fitting of experimental impedance data. The impedance spectra have also indicated that the conduction is predominantly polaronic in nature. The frequency and temperature dependence of the electrical modulis as well as dielectric loss parameters have exhibited a relaxation character attributed to the vanadyl complexes. The relaxation effects have been analyzed by the graphical method. From this analysis, it has been established that there is a spread of relaxation times. The results have been further discussed quantitatively in the light of different valance states of vanadium ions with the aid of the data on spectroscopic properties.

As a part of the accuracy assessment process, in-situ measurements on soil temperature and reference ET (ET0) were recorded at the time of satellite overpass. In order to enhance the accuracy of the generated ET maps, MODIS images were subjected to sub-pixel analysis by assigning weights for different land surface cover (urban, agriculture and multi-surface areas) reflections. The weighting process was achieved by integrating ET from pure pixels with the respective site-specific ET0 of each land cover. The enhanced SEBAL model estimated ET exhibited a good correlation with the in-situ measured Penman-Montieth ET0, with R-2 values for the Aqua and the Terra platforms of 0.67 and 0.73, respectively. However, the correlation of the non-enhanced ET maps resulted in R-2 values of 0.61 and 0.68 for the Aqua and the Terra platforms, respectively.

"A new multi-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for Approximate Bayesian Computation, ABC-SubSim, has recently appeared that exploits the Subset Simulation method for efficient rare-event simulation. ABC-SubSim adaptively creates a nested decreasing sequence of data-approximating regions in the output space that correspond to increasingly closer approximations of the observed output vector in this output space. At each level, multiple samples of the model parameter vector are generated by a component-wise Metropolis algorithm so that the predicted output corresponding to each parameter value falls in the current data-approximating region. Theoretically, if continued to the limit, the sequence of data-approximating regions would converge on to the observed output vector and the approximate posterior distributions, which are conditional on the data approximation region, would become exact, but this is not practically feasible. In this paper we study the performance of the ABC-SubSim algorithm for Bayesian updating of the parameters of dynamical systems using a general hierarchical state-space model. We note that the ABC methodology gives an approximate posterior distribution that actually corresponds to an exact posterior where a uniformly distributed combined measurement and modeling error is added. We also note that ABC algorithms have a problem with learning the uncertain error variances in a stochastic state-space model and so we treat them as nuisance parameters and analytically integrate them out of the posterior distribution. In addition, the statistical efficiency of the original ABC-SubSim algorithm is improved by developing a novel strategy to regulate the proposal variance for the component-wise Metropolis algorithm at each level. We demonstrate that Self-regulated ABC-SubSim is well suited for Bayesian system identification by first applying it successfully to model updating of a two degree-of-freedom linear structure for three cases: globally, locally and unidentifiable model classes, and then to model updating of a two degree-of-freedom nonlinear structure with Duffing nonlinearities in its interstory force-deflection relationship.

"A novel amphiphilic hydroquinone derivative having a C18 alkyl chain phosphate attached to the hydroquinone (HQ) moiety was chemically synthesized. The thermal stability, distribution between organic and aqueous phases, and in vitro skin permeability were evaluated. This HQ derivative was identified as disodium p-phenylene diisostearyl diphosphate (HQ-2P2IS) by UV, infrared, mass, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies. Product HQ-2P2IS was obtained in good yield (56%), and it exhibited satisfactory stability in neutral solution, comparable to that of HQ. Its skin permeability was also higher than that of HQ. HQ-2P2IS is susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis by tissue phosphatase, which releases HQ in the skin tissues. Thus, these characteristics indicate that the novel hydroquinone derivative presented herein, i.e., HQ-2P2IS, may serve as an effective pro-hydroquinone for skin care applications.

"A large amount of silicon in the form of silicon scraps is wasted annually in photovoltaic industry because of the presence of silicon carbide inclusions. Silicon carbide inclusions Must be eliminated so that silicon scraps can be recycled. This study investigated the electromagnetic separation of silicori carbide inclusions in multicrystalline silicon by imposition of supersonic-frequency magnetic field. Silicon carbide particles tend to migrate to the ingot side and to the top and bottom of the central region of the ingot under increasing holding time. During separation process, the penetrating aluminum can react with silicon carbide and then dissolve some of the inclusions. In this work, the separation efficiency reaches up to 893% at a holding time of 45 min. This method is a potentially effective means of recycling silicon scraps. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"A challenge for precise positioning in nanopositioning using smart materials is hysteresis, limiting positioning accuracy. The Preisach model, based on the delayed relay operator for hysteresis modelling, is introduced. The model is identified from experimental data with an input function ensuring information for all input levels. This paper presents implementational issues with respect to hysteresis compensation using the Preisach model, showing the procedure to follow, avoiding pitfalls in both identification and inversion. Issues due to the discrete nature of the Preisach model are discussed, and a specific linear interpolation method is tested experimentally, showing effective avoidance of excitation of vibrational dynamics in the smart material. Experimental results of hysteresis compensation are presented, showing an approximate error of 5% between the reference and measured displacement. Consequences of an insufficient discretization level and a high frequency reference signal are illustrated, showing significant deterioration of the hysteresis compensation performance.

"A new digital predictive control strategy for a single-phase boost power factor correction (PFC) converter is presented in this paper, to reduce the harmonic distortion and improve the dynamic response. Based on the converter circuit structure, the values of output voltage and inductor current of next switching cycle are predicted in advance. The steady-state algorithm and the dynamic-state algorithm are implemented respectively, the duty cycle is calculated only via the predicted output voltage and inductor current values during the steady process, and the optimized duty cycle is predicted during the dynamic process, to improve the characters of PFC converter. The single-phase boost PFC converter with the proposed digital predictive control strategy has been implemented via the field programmable gate array (FPGA). The experimental results indicate that the proposed digital control strategy can improve the power factor and the dynamic response of PFC converter simultaneously.

In children with idiopathic SH the natural evolution is often favourable, with a high percentage of cases reverting to euthyroidism or remaining SH even after a prolonged follow-up. By contrast, the risk of a significant deterioration of thyroid status is distinctly higher in the SH children with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). This risk is even higher in the cases with both HT-related SH and chromosomal abnormalities, such as Turner or Down's syndrome.

"Aiming at improving the poor real-time performance of existing nonlinear filtering algorithms applied to spacecraft autonomous navigation based on Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements and simplifying the algorithm design of navigation algorithms, a spacecraft autonomous navigation algorithm based on polytopic linear differential inclusion is proposed in this paper. Firstly, it is demonstrated that the nonlinear estimation error system of spacecraft autonomous navigation can be modelled as a polytopic linear differential inclusion system model according to the idea of global linearization. Thus, the filtering of a nonlinear system simplified to a filtering of a polytopic linear system with coefficients. Secondly, Tensor-Product (TP) model transformation is applied to determine the polytopic linear differential inclusion system model. The model error introduced by global linearization is reduced and the compromise between computational complexity and modelling accuracy is realised. Finally, a spacecraft autonomous navigation algorithm based on polytopic linear differential inclusion is designed by combining multi-model Kalman filtering with data fusion. Compared with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), the proposed algorithm is simpler and easier to implement since it need not update the Jacobian matrices online. Simulation results demonstrate the same estimation accuracy of the proposed algorithm to that of EKF.

"A large number of individuals experience mental health disorders, with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) emerging as a standard practice for reduction in psychiatric symptoms, including stress, anger, anxiety, and depression. However, CBT is associated with significant patient dropout and lacks the means to provide objective data regarding a patient's experience and symptoms between sessions. Emerging wearables and mobile health (mHealth) applications represent an approach that may provide objective data to the patient and provider between CBT sessions. Here, we describe the development of a classifier of real-time physiological stress in a healthy population (n = 35) and apply it in a controlled clinical evaluation for armed forces veterans undergoing CBT for stress and anger management (n = 16). Using cardiovascular and electrodermal inputs from a wearable device, the classifier was able to detect physiological stress in a non-clinical sample with accuracy greater than 90%. In a small clinical sample, patients who used the classifier and an associated mHealth application were less likely to discontinue therapy (p = 0.016, d = 1.34) and significantly improved on measures of stress (p = 0.032, d = 1.61), anxiety (p = 0.050, d = 1.26), and anger (p = 0.046, d = 1.41) compared to controls undergoing CBT alone. Given the large number of individuals that experience mental health disorders and the unmet need for treatment, especially in developing nations, such mHealth approaches have the potential to provide or augment treatment at low cost in the absence of in-person care.

"Arsenic contamination in drinking ground water has reached an alarming situation in parts of Bengal Delta, India. Development of methods for removal of arsenic contamination from the drinking water will be of great importance for the mankind. The main objective of this study was to isolate and characterize arsenic resistant bacteria (ARB) from the surface water of Kabar Wetland (6.066 +/- 0.23 mg/L As) located in Begusarai district of Bihar province (25 degrees 35'N and 86 degrees 10'E), India. Bacteria were isolated from water sample by enrichment culture technique and based on their 16S rRNA gene sequences, isolates tolerating 150mM arsenate/As(V) were identified as Paracoccus sp strain NC-A and Alcaligenes faecalis strain NC-B, whereas isolate resistant to 30mM arsenite/As(lll) was identified as Stenotrophomonas sp. strain NC-C. Bioinformatic analysis of genome of reference strains revealed the presence of different arsenic resistance (ars) genes. Arsenic removal efficiency of isolates was evaluated and it was observed that As(V) resistant strains of Paracoccus and Alcaligenes removed up to 84.5% and 93% arsenic, respectively from the external growth medium, whereas, As(111) resistant strain of Stenotrophomonas sp. removed 79.6% arsenic from the culture broth. The optimum pH, temperature and nutrient levels (peptone water) for arsenic removal by these isolates were 7.0, 35 degrees C and (PW/60), respectively. These observations suggest that the strains described in this study are capable of removing arsenic from the dilute solutions, and hence being natural isolates, these strains can be easily used in the purification of arsenic contaminated water and thereby check the increasing arsenic toxicity in human food chain.

"A methodology is proposed to update mechanics-based nonlinear finite element (FE) models of civil structures subjected to unknown input excitation. The approach allows to jointly estimate unknown time-invariant model parameters of a nonlinear FE model of the structure and the unknown time histories of input excitations using spatially-sparse output response measurements recorded during an earthquake event. The unscented. Kalman filter, which circumvents the computation of FE response sensitivities with respect to the unknown model parameters and unknown input excitations by using a deterministic sampling approach, is employed as the estimation tool. The use of measurement data obtained from arrays of heterogeneous sensors, including accelerometers, displacement sensors, and strain gauges is investigated. Based on the estimated FE model parameters and input excitations, the updated nonlinear FE model can be interrogated to detect, localize, classify, and assess damage in the structure. Numerically simulated response data of a three-dimensional 4-story 2-by-1 bay steel frame structure with six unknown model parameters subjected to unknown bi-directional horizontal seismic excitation, and a three-dimensional 5-story 2-by-1 bay reinforced concrete frame structure with nine unknown model parameters subjected to unknown bi-directional horizontal seismic excitation are used to illustrate and validate the proposed methodology. The results of the validation studies show the excellent performance and robustness of the proposed algorithm to jointly estimate unknown FE model parameters and unknown input excitations.

Most research in this area relies on single cases with a specific AAL application and a limited number of users. To fill this gap, a content analyses of 35 AAL reports was conducted. The aim was to provide a comprehensive overview of potential incentives for using AAL technologies. The data was coded using the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). In total 13 incentives could be identified, which were grouped into six categories: (1) social incentives, (2) health and safety incentives, (3) activity incentives, (4) novel sensory incentives, (5) status incentives and (6) self-reactive incentives. Within these categories 'social connectedness' and 'health and safety' were the most important incentives.

"A novel label-free system for the sensitive fluorescent detection of deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) activity has been developed by utilizing DNA-templated silver nanocluster/graphene oxide (DNA-AgNC/GO) nanocomposite. AgNC is first synthesized around C-rich template DNA and the resulting DNA-AgNC binds to GO through the interaction between the extension DNA and GO. The resulting DNA-AgNC/GO would show quite reduced fluorescence signal because the fluorescence from DNA-AgNCs is quenched by GO. In the presence of DNase I, however, it degrades the DNA strand within DNA/RNA hybrid duplex probe employed in this study, consequently releasing RNA which is complementary to the extension DNA. The released free RNA then extracts DNA-AgNC from GO by hybridizing with the extension DNA bound to GO. This process would restore the quenched fluorescence, emitting highly enhanced fluorescence signal. By employing this assay principle, DNase I activity was reliably identified with a detection limit of 0.10 U/ml which is lower than those from previous fluorescence-based methods. Finally, the practical capability of this assay system was successfully demonstrated by its use to determine DNase I activity in bovine urine. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Ankle bracelets (anklets) imposed by law to track convicted individuals are being used in many countries as an alternative to overloaded prisons. There are many different systems for monitoring individuals wearing such devices, and these electronic anklet monitoring systems commonly detect violations of circulation areas permitted to holders. In spite of being able to monitor individual localization, such systems do not identify grouping activities of the monitored individuals, although this kind of event could represent a real risk of further offenses planned by those individuals. In order to address such a problem and to help monitoring systems to be able to have a proactive approach, this paper proposes sensor data fusion algorithms that are able to identify such groups based on data provided by anklet positioning devices. The results from the proposed algorithms can be applied to support risk assessment in the context of monitoring systems. The processing is performed using geographic points collected by a monitoring center, and as result, it produces a history of groups with their members, timestamps, locations and frequency of meetings. The proposed algorithms are validated in various serial and parallel computing scenarios, and the correspondent results are presented and discussed. The information produced by the proposed algorithms yields to a better characterization of the monitored individuals and can be adapted to support decision-making systems used by authorities that are responsible for planning decisions regarding actions affecting public security.

"A gluten-free diet (GFD) has been reported to negatively impact the quality of life (QoL) of coeliac disease (CD) patients. The gut-brain axis hormones ghrelin and leptin, with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), may affect QoL of CD patients undergoing GFD. Our aims were to evaluate whether: (a) the circulating concentrations of leptin, ghrelin and BDNF in CD patients were different from those in healthy subjects; (b) GFD might induce changes in their levels; (c) BDNF Val66Met polymorphism variability might affect BDNF levels; and (d) serum BDNF levels were related to dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as a neurotrophin modulator. Nineteen adult coeliac patients and 21 healthy controls were included. A QoL questionnaire was administered, and serum concentrations of ghrelin, leptin, BDNF and red blood cell membrane DHA levels were determined at the enrolment and after 1 year of GFD. BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was analysed. Results from the questionnaire indicated a decline in QoL after GFD. Ghrelin and leptin levels were not significantly different between groups. BDNF levels were significantly (p = 0.0213) lower in patients after GFD (22.0 +/- 2.4 ng/ml) compared to controls (31.2 +/- 2.2 ng/ml) and patients at diagnosis (25.0 +/- 2.5 ng/ml). BDNF levels correlated with DHA levels (p = 0.008, r = 0.341) and the questionnaire total score (p = 0.041, r = 0.334). Ghrelin and leptin seem to not be associated with changes in QoL of patients undergoing dietetic treatment. In contrast, a link between BDNF reduction and the vulnerability of CD patients to psychological distress could be proposed, with DHA representing a possible intermediate.

"Adverse parenting is associated with an increased risk for the development of mood and behavioral disorders. In this study, we assessed the perceived parental bonding of 232 medical students using the parental bonding instrument (PBI) and extracted 22 students who reported their parents' rearing attitudes as affectionless control (LOW; low care, high overprotection). Using the 28-item general health questionnaire, the Zung self-rating depression scale (Zung-SDS), the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), and the Spielberger state-trait-anxiety-inventory (STAI), physical and mental state of the LOW students were compared with those of 30 students who reported their parental bonding as optimal (OPT; high care and low overprotection). These questionnaire measurements demonstrated significantly higher anxiety and depressive mood in the LOW students versus the OPT students. Compared with the OPT students, the LOW students also exhibited a significantly reduced salivary cortisol awakening response (CAR) without changes across the rest of the diurnal salivary cortisol profile. Among glucocorticoid-related genes examined (GR, ADRB2, IB, IL10, IL1R2, IL1RN, MR, MC2R, TGFB1, TGFB2 and FASLG), real-time reverse transcription-PCR showed that the LOW students significantly increased expression of a dominant negative glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA and decreased 2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) mRNA levels in circulating leukocytes. These results suggest that negative perception of parents' child-rearing attitudes may be associated with anxiety and depressive mood and altered glucocorticoid signaling even in healthy young adults.

"A new diffusion sign subband adaptive filtering algorithm with an individual weighting factor (IWF-DSSAF) for each subband is proposed for distributed estimation in the impulsive noise environment. Since the inherent decorrelating property of subband adaptive filtering is fully used, the proposed algorithm obtains better performance in terms of convergence rate and tracking capability as compared with the diffusion sign subband adaptive filtering (DSSAF) algorithm. In addition, the stability analysis of the IWF-DSSAF algorithm is performed based on Price's theorem. After that, in order to obtain a faster convergence rate in sparse distributed system identification, the improved proportionate IWF-DSSAF algorithm is proposed, in which a gain distribution matrix is incorporated into the IWF-DSSAF algorithm. Finally, simulations are carried out in the distributed system identification context.

"A novel controller is proposed to regulate the DC-link voltage of a single phase active power filter (SPAPF). The proposed switched fractional controller (SFC) consists of a conventional PI controller, a fractional order PI (FO-PI) controller and a decision maker that switches between them. Commonly, the conventional PI controller is used in regulation loops due to its advantages in steady-state but it is limited in transient state. On the other hand, the FO-PI controller overcomes these drawbacks but it causes dramatic degradation in control performances in steady-state because of the fractional calculus theory and the approximation method used to implement this kind of controller. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to switch to the PI controller in steady-state to obtain the best power quality and to switch to the FO-PI controller when external disturbances are detected to guarantee a fast transient state. To investigate the efficiency and accuracy of the SFC considering all robustness tests, an experimental setup has been established. The results of the SFC fulfill the requirements, confirm its high performances in steady and transient states and demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness.

"A fully digital, nonlinear, wide-bandwidth current controller for dc-ac and dc-dc voltage source converters is presented in this paper. Exploiting over-sampling, the controller mimics an analog hysteresis current controller, but it does not employ analog comparators, digital-to-analog converters, or any other analog signal pre- or postprocessing circuitry. Indeed, it fully virtualizes the hysteresis controller's operation and, based only on a nonlinear, efficient current error processing algorithm, drives the power converter at almost constant switching frequency. Overall, it offers the same excellent dynamic performance of the analog hysteresis controller and, at the same time, solves most of the related problems. Because the current error sample processing algorithm is inherently parallel in structure, the controller is suited for VHDL synthesis and field-programmable gate-array implementation, which guarantees flexibility and low cost, together with minimum computation and signal conversion delays. Its intended application areas include active filters, uninterruptible power supplies, microgrid distributed energy resource controllers, laboratory battery testers, and welding machines.

"Aptamers are short, single-stranded nucleic acids that fold into well-defined three dimensional (3D) structures that allow for binding to a target molecule with affinities and specificities that can rival or in some cases exceed those of antibodies.

Using fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrated the ability of the sulforhodamine B aptamer to bind its cognate target while sequestered in a chitosan-hyaluronan film matrix. Studies using Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry also suggest that deposition conditions such as rinsing time and volume play a strong role in the internal film interactions and growth mechanisms of chitosan-hyaluronan films.

"Aging is associated with a progressive loss of the CD28 costimulatory molecule in CD4(+) lymphocytes (CD28(null) T cells), which is accompanied by the acquisition of new biological and functional properties that give rise to an impaired immune response. The regulatory mechanisms that govern the appearance and function of this cell subset during aging and in several associated inflammatory disorders remain controversial. Here, we present the whole-genome DNA methylation and gene expression profiles of CD28(null) T cells and its CD28(+) counterpart. A comparative analysis revealed that 296 genes are differentially methylated between the two cell subsets. A total of 160 genes associated with cytotoxicity (e.g. GRZB, TYROBP, and RUNX3) and cytokine/chemokine signaling (e.g. CX3CR1, CD27, and IL-1R) are demethylated in CD28(null) T cells, while 136 de novo-methylated genes matched defects in the TCR signaling pathway (e.g. ITK, TXK, CD3G, and LCK). TCR-landscape analysis confirmed that CD28(null) T cells have an oligo/monoclonal expansion over the polyclonal background of CD28(+) T cells, but feature a V family repertoire specific to each individual. We reported that CD28(null) T cells show a preactivation state characterized by a higher level of expression of inflammasome-related genes that leads to the release of IL-1 when activated. Overall, our results demonstrate that CD28(null) T cells have a unique DNA methylation landscape, which is associated with differences in gene expression, contributing to the functionality of these cells. Understanding these epigenetic regulatory mechanisms could suggest novel therapeutic strategies to prevent the accumulation and activation of these cells during aging.

"A body of evidence has implicated dietary deficiency in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the pathophysiology and etiology of recurrent mood disorders including major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder. Cross-national and cross-sectional evidence suggests that greater habitual intake of n-3 PUFA is associated with reduced risk for developing mood symptoms. Meta-analyses provide strong evidence that patients with mood disorders exhibit low blood n-3 PUFA levels which are associated with increased risk for the initial development of mood symptoms in response to inflammation. While the etiology of this n-3 PUFA deficit may be multifactorial, n-3 PUFA supplementation is sufficient to correct this deficit and may also have antidepressant effects. Rodent studies suggest that n-3 PUFA deficiency during perinatal development can recapitulate key neuropathological, neurochemical, and behavioral features associated with mood disorders. Clinical neuroimaging studies suggest that low n-3 PUFA biostatus is associated with abnormalities in cortical structure and function also observed in mood disorders. Collectively, these findings implicate dietary n-3 PUFA insufficiency, particularly during development, in the pathophysiology of mood dysregulation, and support implementation of routine screening for and treatment of n-3 PUFA deficiency in patients with mood disorders.

To compute the normal spectral emittances, a Monte Carlo Ray Tracing code was carefully used through an indirect method based on Kirchhoff's laws. The Monte Carlo Ray Tracing code considers the complex refractive index of the solid phase constituting the struts foams. Particular attention is therefore paid to performing the calculation with absorption indices (0.5-8) that preserve the opacity of each strut. From a thorough analysis of the ray transport within all the foams, Where the Representative Elementary Volumes used for computing the homogenized radiative properties were known beforehand, a general and simple law is established that connects the normal spectral emittance, on the one hand, and the open porosity and the complex index of refraction, on the other hand. In the field of the thermal conversion of solar energy, for example, the new law gives relevant insight on the radiative performance of highly porous foams that are virtually coated with materials that are known for possessing an undeniable spectral selectivity when they are shaped as dense samples.

"A simultaneous bidirectional transceiver over a single wire has been developed in a 65 nm CMOS technology for a command and control bus. The echo signals of the simultaneous bidirectional link are cancelled by controlling the decision level of receiver comparators without power-hungry operational amplifier (op-amp) based circuits. With the clock information embedded in the rising edges of the signals sent from the source side to the sink side, the data is recovered by an open-loop digital circuit with 20 times blind oversampling. The data rate of the simultaneous bidirectional transceiver in each direction is 75 Mbps and therefore the overall signaling bandwidth is 150 Mbps. The measured energy efficiency of the transceiver is 56.7 pJ/b and the bit-error-rate (BER) is less than 10(-12) with 2(7)-1 pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) pattern for both signaling directions.

"Acting as a focus of network security field, Intrusion Detection Technology (IDT) plays a very important role in different conditions. Feature selection methods for intrusion detection directly affect the efficiency of Intrusion Detect System. In this paper, feature selection algorithm based on Relief and Relief Sequential Backward Search (Relief-SBS) is proposed under considering statistical correlation of Relief and Relief-SBS. The improved algorithm eliminates a feature after each round of iteration, and adopts the result of Relief algorithm as the assessment criteria for feature. Simulation results show that the proposed feature selection algorithm improves the efficiency of intrusion detection; moreover, it provides correlation technique support for IDT.

"A pilot study assessed whether clinicians at an urban college health center met the reproductive needs (emergency contraception and contraception) of students. Physicians and nurse practitioners completed a 5-item survey about prescribing emergency contraception and contraception. Clinician prescribing practices varied, which may have resulted in contraceptive needs (for some students) not being met in a timely manner. Clinicians had different understandings of policies about prescribing contraceptives when on-call, when students called in, and for students who had graduated. Education and policies about handling EC and contraception requests are necessary so that clinicians meet students' reproductive health needs.

"A gastrointestinal parasite survey of 411 stray and refuge dogs sampled from four geographical and climactically distinct locations in India revealed these animals to represent a significant source of environmental contamination for parasites that pose a zoonotic risk to the public. Hookworms were the most commonly identified parasite in dogs in Sikkim (71.3%), Mumbai (48.8%) and Delhi (39.1%). In Ladakh, which experiences harsh extremes in climate, a competitive advantage was observed for parasites such as Sarcocystis spp. (44.2%), Taenia hydatigena (30.3%) and Echinococcus granulosus (2.3%) that utilise intermediate hosts for the completion of their life cycle. PCR identified Ancylostoma ceylanicum and Ancylostoma caninum to occur sympatrically, either as single or mixed infections in Sikkim (Northeast) and Mumbai (West). In Delhi, A. caninum was the only species identified in dogs, probably owing to its ability to evade unfavourable climatic conditions by undergoing arrested development in host tissue. The expansion of the known distribution of A. ceylanicum to the west, as far as Mumbai, justifies the renewed interest in this emerging zoonosis and advocates for its surveillance in future human parasite surveys. Of interest was the absence of Trichuris vulpis in dogs, in support of previous canine surveys in India. This study advocates the continuation of birth control programmes in stray dogs that will undoubtedly have spill-over effects on reducing the levels of environmental contamination with parasite stages. In particular, owners of pet animals exposed to these environments must be extra vigilant in ensuring their animals are regularly dewormed and maintaining strict standards of household and personal hygiene.

"Ambient vibration tests and analyses of a long-span rigid-frame bridge were conducted using distributed long-gauge fiber-optic sensors. The concept of a long-gauge fiber-optic sensor and its merit to reveal local and global structural features are presented. Monitoring of a long-span bridge was performed using long-gauge sensors, and a method to calculate structural deformation distribution from the measured long-gauge strains is proposed, in which shear-deformation effect is considered because the main girder of the studied bridge is deep with a length-depth ratio of 17.9 at the end of the middle span. Modal identification of the studied bridge using the measured long-gauge dynamic strains was also performed, from which strain and displacement mode shapes were identified. Those results demonstrate the superiority of long-gauge fiber-optic sensors and their successful application to the studied bridge. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

"A wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of energy-limited autonomous tiny devices spatially distributed so as to monitor their environments. They have a very wide application domain ranging from military applications to health care services, logistics, or agriculture. Efficient use of sensor energies and network security are of utmost importance, given their possible application domains and operational properties. Multipath routing and multi-copy forwarding are well-known approaches shown to be useful against several threats. In this paper we study the design of an energy-efficient and reliable WSN. We discuss four different routing strategies with multipath routing and various levels of multi-copying, namely, the no, full, and partial redundancy cases. Moreover, we incorporate balanced energy dissipation in our models not only to improve network lifetime, which is the time until the first sensor in the network exhausts its energy, but also to eliminate critical nodes, which are appealing for malicious attacks. We construct mathematical models of all these protocols and present some test results so as to display the trade-off between energy efficiency and network reliability. We compare their performance in terms of network lifetime and the amount of data successfully transmitted in case of an inconvenience. The full data redundancy protocol yields a more reliable design than the balanced utilization with no redundancy or the partial redundancy protocols in exchange for a quite significant degradation in network lifetime. However, the partial redundancy protocol provides a slightly less reliable WSN than the full redundancy case with almost 60% longer lifetime. As a result, we can suggest that our partial multi-copy protocol with extended balanced utilization rule is quite favourable for operating networks energy efficiently and securely.

"An outstanding Saharan dust event affected the Iberian Peninsula during winter 2016 (20 to 25 February). The impact of this event on ambient PM10 surface levels and its spatial and temporal evolution was investigated by means of data from 250 air quality stations across mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands. The event had a significant impact on surface PM10 levels, and on 22 February, 90% of the air quality monitoring sites registered PM10 concentrations above the EU daily limit value of 50g/m(3). The study of the attenuated backscattering vertical profiles associated with African dust evidenced a complex structure, with a thick aerosol layer that was at higher altitudes over the pre-Pyrenees compared to the coastal area of Barcelona but closer to the surface than typically observed at both sites. Optical and physical properties of dust particles were investigated at the continental background Global Atmosphere Watch mountain observatory of Montsec (MSA) in the pre-Pyrenees. Good agreement was found between in situ and passive remote sensing methodologies once the aloft dust layer reached the MSA station. Scattering angstrom ngstrom exponent values decreased to values close to zero (even below zero for surface in situ measurements) indicating the predominance of coarse particles. On the contrary, absorption angstrom ngstrom exponent values increased during the Saharan dust outbreak denoting an absorption enhancement at shorter wavelengths, characteristic of mineral dust particles. Furthermore, the performance of NMMB/BSC-Dust and BSC-DREAM8b models has been qualitatively evaluated for the dust spatial distribution across Spain and the vertical structure over MSA and Barcelona showing good agreement.

"A review of epidemiological studies on the incidence of MRSA infections overtime was performed along with an analysis of data available for download from Hospital Compare (https://data.medicare.gov/data/hospital-compare). We found the estimations of the incidence of MRSA infections varied widely depending upon the type of population studied, the types of infections captured and in the definitions and terminology used to describe the results. We could not find definitive evidence that the incidence of MRSA infections in U.S. community or facilities is decreasing significantly. Of concern are recent data reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) on MRSA bloodstream infections which indicate that by the end of 2015 there had been little change in the average facility Standardized Infection Ratio (0.988), compared to a 2010-2011 baseline and is significantly increased compared to the previous year. This is in contradistinction to the recent Veterans Administration study which reported over an 80% reduction in MRSA infections. However, this discrepancy may be due to the inability to reconcile the baselines of the two data sets; and the observed increase may be artifactual due to aberrations in the NHSN tracking system. Our review supports the need for implementation of a comprehensive tracking and monitoring system involving all types of healthcare facilities for multi-drug resistant organisms, along with concomitant funding for both staff and infrastructure. Without such a system, determining the effectiveness of interventions such as antibiotic stewardship and chlorhexidine bathing will be hindered.

"A comprehensive approach to the real-time simulation of power converters using a state-space representation is covered in this paper. Systematic formulations of state-space equations as well as a new switch model are presented. The proposed switch model exhibits a natural switching behavior, which is a valuable characteristic for the real-time simulation of power converters, thereby allowing individual treatment of switching devices irrespective of the converter topology. Successful implementations of the proposed switch model on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) device are reported, with two alternative approaches: 1) precomputing network equations for all switch state combinations and 2) solving network equations on-chip using the Gauss-Seidel iterative method. A two-level three-phase voltage source converter is implemented using the first approach, with a time step of 80 ns and a switching frequency of 200 kHz. Ideal and nonideal boost converters are also implemented on FPGA using the second approach, with a time step of 75 ns and a switching frequency of 20 kHz. Comparison with SPICE models shows that the proposed switch model offers very satisfactory accuracy and precision.

"A good virtual Learning Space (LS) should convey pertinent learning information to the visitors at the most adequate time and locations to favor their knowledge acquisition. Considering the consolidation of the internet and the improvement of the interaction, searching, and learning mechanisms, we propose a generic architecture, called CaVa, to create virtual Learning Spaces building up on cultural institution documents. More precisely, our proposal is to automatically create ontology-based virtual learning environments. Thus, to impart relevant learning materials to the virtual LS, we propose the use of ontologies to represent the key concepts and semantic relations in an user- and machine-understandable format. These concepts together with the data (extracted from the real documents) stored in a digital storage format (XML datasets, relational databases, etc.) are displayed in an ontology-based learning space that enables the visitors to use the available features and tools to learn about a specific domain. According to the approach here discussed, each desired virtual LS must be specified rigorously through a domain specific language (DSL) that was designed and implemented. To validate the proposed architecture, three case studies will be used as instances of CaVa architecture. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

"A frequently occurring subcircuit consists of a loop of a resistor (R), a field-effect transistor (FET), and a capacitor (C). The FET acts as a switch, controlled at its gate terminal by a clock voltage. There may be many such identical circuits connected in parallel, each driven by a different phase of the clock. This subcircuit may be acting as a sample-and-hold (S/H), as a passive mixer (P-M), or as a bandpass filter or bandpass impedance. In this work, we will present a useful analysis that leads to a simple signal flow graph (SFG), which captures the FET-R-C circuit's action completely across a wide range of design parameters. The SFG dissects the circuit into three filtering functions and ideal sampling. This greatly simplifies analysis of frequency response, noise, input impedance, and conversion gain, and leads to guidelines for optimum design. The analysis is extended to multi- path realizations common in RF applications. Part I of this paper focuses on the analyses of a single-path FET-R-C circuit's signal transfer characteristics. Part II extends these analyses to multi- path FET-R-C circuit configurations, which is followed by the noise and driving-point impedance analyses.

There were significant differences between the groups on several balance and gait scales, with a worse performance and greater risk of falls in the acromegalic older adults. Acromegalic older adults had lower values for peak torque, maximum repetition of the total work, and total work during extension at 240 degrees/s. The acromegalic older adults had higher values in the medial-lateral range. Acromegaly subjects had lateral instability that compromises their body balance and increases the risk of falls.

"Acceptance and intention to use mobile learning is a topic of growing interest in the field of education. Although there is a considerable amount of studies investigating mobile learning acceptance, little research exists that investigates the driving factors that influence students' intention to use mobile technologies for assessment purposes. The aim of this study is to provide empirical evidence on the acceptance of Mobile-Based Assessment (MBA), the assessment delivered through mobile devices and technologies. The proposed model, Mobile-Based Assessment Acceptance Model (MBAAM) is based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). MBAAM extends TAM in the context of MBA by adding to the Perceived Ease of Use and Perceived Usefulness, the constructs of Facilitating Conditions, Social Influence, Mobile Device Anxiety, Personal Innovativeness, Mobile-Self-Efficacy, Perceived Trust, Content, Cognitive Feedback, User Interface and Perceived Ubiquity Value and investigates their impact on the Behavioral Intention to Use MBA. 145 students from a European senior-level secondary school experienced a series of mobile-based assessments for a three-week period.

"A new microbent in-line microfiber interferometer (MI-MI) is proposed and demonstrated as a compact temperature and current sensor. The MI-MI is capable of generating interference fringes with a high extinction ratio of about 12.0 dB and a free spectral range of 1.9 nm at a wavelength of 1545 nm. When employed as a temperature sensor, a copper wire carrying a direct current is placed against the MI-MI sensor, and the interference fringes of the MI-MI sensor shifts toward the longer wavelength as the heat generated by the copper wire increases. As the temperature increase corresponds linearly to the current, thus the measurement of the current can be extrapolated as well. The sensor has a temperature responsivity of 33.0 pm/degrees C with a linearity of more than 0.97 as well as a current responsitivity of 1.46 degrees C/A(2), and has significant potential for application as a health and warning sensor for electricity generation and distribution grids.

"A 3-D finite element model for Yueyang Dongting Lake bridge was established with a large scale general finite element analysis software, and the subspace iteration method was adopted to analyze the natural vibration characteristics of the bridge, meanwhile, the influences of settings different types of central buckles at the mid-span of the main spans between the main cables and girder on the dynamic behaviors of the long-span suspension bridge with deck-truss composite stiffening girder were studied. The results show that compared with only setting short hanger cable at mid-span, the the whole rigidity of suspension bridge is raised and the natural frequencies increase by the setting central buckle, but various types of vibration modes are affected in different extents; among all of these vibration modes, the antisymmetric vibration and Longitudinal floating of stiffening girder are most obviously affected. The stiffness of central buckle has a great influence on the vibration of main cable, while compared with only setting short hanger cable, the vibration of main cable increases 7.32% while setting the rigid central buckle. The conclusions of this paper provide theoretical basis for the using of central buckle in long-span suspension bridge.

"A label-free porous silicon (pSi) based, optical biosensor, using both an antibody and aptamer bioreceptor motif has been developed for the detection of insulin. Two parallel biosensors were designed and optimised independently, based on each bioreceptor. Both bioreceptors were covalently attached to a thermally hydrosilylated pSi surface though amide coupling, with unreacted surface area rendered stable and low fouling by incorporation of PEG moieties. The insulin detection ability of each biosensor was determined using interferometric reflectance spectroscopy, using a range of different media both with and without serum. Sensing performance was compared in terms of response value, response time and limit of detection (LOD) for each platform. In order to demonstrate the capability of the best performing biosensor to detect insulin from real samples, an in vitro investigation with the aptamer-modified surface was performed. This biosensor was exposed to buffer conditioned by glucose-stimulated human islets, with the result showing a positive response and a high degree of selectivity towards insulin capture. The obtained results correlated well with the ELISA used in the clinic for assaying glucose-stimulated insulin release from donor islets. We anticipate that this type of sensor can be applied as a rapid point-of-use biosensor to assess the quality of donor islets in terms of their insulin production efficiency, prior to transplantation.

"A cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) based detector system has been developed with the goal of combining molecular breast imaging (MBI) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to address shortcomings of each modality. The CZT detector system is comprised of four CZT modules tiled in a 2x2 array. Each module consists of 256 pixels (16 x 16, 2.4 mm pixels) and features a built-in ASIC and FPGA. A custom digital readout circuit board was designed to interface the four modules with a microcontroller to a data acquisition PC. The system was placed within the bore of a 3 T GE Discovery MR750 and imaging performance of each modality evaluated using both sequential and simultaneous imaging protocols. The mean energy resolution of the gamma camera both inside and outside the MRI is 7.3% at 140 keV. The maximum increase in the integral uniformity was 3% when using a gradient echo MRI sequence while the mean differential uniformity when inside the MRI increased by 1%. Spatial resolution varied in a predictable manner from 2.4 mm FWHM at the collimator face to 6.9 mm at 10 cm from the collimator. Performance of the 3 T GE Discovery MR750 using a 16-channel breast RF coil array was measured with and without the gamma camera present using a gradient echo and spoiled gradient echo imaging sequence. A realistic 99mTc-filled breast-like phantom containing two lesions (30: 1 lesion to background ratio) was used to assess the feasibility of both serial and simultaneous hybrid imaging. Sequential imaging resulted in a reduction in MRI SNR of 70-80% and a further decrease of 93-98% was observed when performing simultaneous MR/scintigraphy imaging, likely a result of RF interference originating from the CZT detector modules and associated analog electronics. Co-registered scintigraphic and MRI images display negligible geometric distortion when imaged with both simultaneous and serial imaging modes, thus indicating the feasibility of combining MBI with breast MRI.

The corrosion behavior and mechanisms of pure nickel (Ni), GH4033 and GH4169 in 793 K molten eutectic NaCl-MgCl2 were studied. During the initial stage of corrosion, pure Ni and GH4033 gain weight from the many plate-like shells formed on the sample surface. After corrosion for 40 h, all sample surfaces were rather porous and loosened. MgO nuclei that were attached to the loosened microstructure surface fell off with the microstructures, which led to a continual decrease in the sample weight. The three sample surfaces were mainly composed of MgO and Ni or (Ni, Fe) from the sample substrate. Al and Ti were preferentially oxidized and stably excited on the GH4033 surface, which inhibits the corrosion process.

Moreover, the numerical solution of the system is obtained by the step-down order method and the power series method progressively. The effects of the parameters in fractional-order PID controller on the dynamical properties are characterized by some new equivalent parameters. The proportional component of fractional-order PID controller is characterized in the form of equivalent mass. The integral component of fractional-order PID controller is denoted in the form of the equivalent linear damping and equivalent mass. The differential component of fractional-order PID controller is denoted in the form of the equivalent linear negative damping and equivalent mass. Those equivalent parameters could distinctly illustrate the effects of the parameters in fractional PID controller on the dynamical response. A comparison between the analytical solution with the numerical results is made, and their satisfactory agreement verifies the correctness of the approximately analytical results.

The experimental results showed that the P(MMA-co-MAA) hydrogels assume a three-networks architecture in morphologies, and that nearly spherical Ag nanoparticles are formed in these hydrogel networks; the size of these Ag nanoparticles varies with the system composition. The swelling kinetics investigations demonstrated that the equilibrium swelling ratio (ESR) of the P(MMA-co-MAA)/Ag hydrogels depended on the content of the MAA and pH of the buffer solutions, and the ESR values were reduced with increasing MAA contents. The antibacterial properties against both S. aureus and B. subtilis bacteria demonstrated that the P(MMA-co-MAA)/silver nanocomposite hydrogels had higher antimicrobial efficacy than the pure P(MMA-co-MAA) counterparts. Therefore, the nanocomposite hydrogels turned out to be a potentially smart material in the range of applications of antibacterial activity.

"A tangent vector field on a surface is the generator of a smooth family of maps from the surface to itself, known as the flow. Given a scalar function on the surface, it can be transported, or advected, by composing it with a vector field's flow. Such transport is exhibited by many physical phenomena, e.g., in fluid dynamics. In this paper, we are interested in the inverse problem: given source and target functions, compute a vector field whose flow advects the source to the target. We propose a method for addressing this problem, by minimizing an energy given by the advection constraint together with a regularizing term for the vector field. Our approach is inspired by a similar method in computational anatomy, known as LDDMM, yet leverages the recent framework of functional vector fields for discretizing the advection and the flow as operators on scalar functions. The latter allows us to efficiently generalize LDDMM to curved surfaces, without explicitly computing the flow lines of the vector field we are optimizing for. We show two approaches for the solution: using linear advection with multiple vector fields, and using non-linear advection with a single vector field. We additionally derive an approximated gradient of the corresponding energy, which is based on a novel vector field transport operator. Finally, we demonstrate applications of our machinery to intrinsic symmetry analysis, function interpolation and map improvement.

"A longstanding debate exists in population policy about the relationship between modern contraception and abortion. Although theory predicts that they should be substitutes, the empirical evidence is difficult to interpret. What is required is a large-scale intervention that alters the supply (or full price) of one or the other and, importantly, that does so in isolation (reproductive health programs often bundle primary health care and family planning-and in some instances, abortion services). In this article, we study Nepal's 2004 legalization of abortion provision and subsequent expansion of abortion services, an unusual and rapidly implemented policy meeting these requirements. Using four waves of rich individual-level data representative of fertile-age Nepalese women, we find robust evidence of substitution between modern contraception and abortion. This finding has important implications for public policy and foreign aid, suggesting that an effective strategy for reducing expensive and potentially unsafe abortions may be to expand the supply of modern contraceptives.

We show how to devise a transition path from the current U.S. system to a saving-for-retirement system that increases the welfare of all current and future generations, with estimates of future gains higher than those found in typically used macroeconomic models. The gains are large because there is more productive capital than commonly assumed.

"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by clinical and biological heterogeneity. Despite the advances in our understanding of its pathobiology, the chemotherapy-directed management has remained largely unchanged in the past 40 years. However, various novel agents have demonstrated clinical activity, either as single agents (e.g., isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) inhibitors, vadastuximab) or in combination with standard induction/consolidation at diagnosis and with salvage regimens at relapse. The classes of agents described in this review include novel cytotoxic chemotherapies (CPX-351 and vosaroxin), epigenetic modifiers (guadecitabine, IDH inhibitors, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) inhibitors), FMS-like tyrosine kinase receptor 3 (FLT3) inhibitors, and antibody-drug conjugates (vadastuximab), as well as cell cycle inhibitors (volasertib), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitors, and aminopeptidase inhibitors. These agents are actively undergoing clinical investigation alone or in combination with available chemotherapy.

In the physical examination a plethora was noted and laboratory examinations revealed polyglobulia. In the subsequent diagnostic process polycythemia vera and cancer could be excluded as the cause. A secondary polyglobulia due to testosterone substitution was diagnosed. Unphysiologically high testosterone levels represent a rare cause of secondary polyglobulia and with an appropriate medical history should be taken into account at an early stage.

"A new kind of cloud service, called Database-as-aservice (DaaS), provides a novel paradigm which allows data to be stored in remote databases. The types of database used in remote sites can be divided into two categories: Relational Databases (RDB) and NoSQL. NoSQL databases store data in a flexible format, and without schema, so NoSQL databases can be easily scaled across multiple devices. Because of the advantages of the NoSQL databases, many large data applications use NoSQL databases as the backend data management system. Because NoSQL databases usually access the stored data as files, through a distributed file system, the problem of decentralized data management is critical in NoSQL databases. In order to address this issue, many energy-efficient algorithms for file placement are used in distributed file systems. However, these energy-efficient algorithms only focus on reducing the power consumption of storage systems and they ignore the cost of data reliability, which is affected by frequently setting the disk status to standby mode. To maintain data reliability, energy-efficient storage systems usually combine framework of power conservation and a fault tolerance mechanism. However, most developers of energy-efficient frameworks do not consider whether the fault tolerance mechanism can avoid data loss when this combination is used for energy-efficient storage systems. This study proposes a general energy-efficient framework that can be integrated different fault tolerance mechanisms. The experimental results show that the capability of the proposed framework with different erasure code algorithms.

"A sensitive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method was established for the simultaneous determination of thirteen N-nitrosamines (NAs) in skin care cosmetics. The cosmetics samples were firstly dispersed by water and subsequently extracted and purified using salting out-acetonitrile homogeneous extraction method. Finally, the extracting solution was concentrated by slow nitrogen gas blowing. All of the samples were separated by INNOWAX capillary chromatographic column, and detected by selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and quantified by isotope internal standard method. The method was validated for linearity and range, accuracy, precision and sensitivity. Under the optimized condition, the calibration curves were linear over the selected concentration ranges of 2-500 mu g/L for all the thirteen analytes, with calculated coefficients of determination (R-2) of greater than 0.996. The limits of detection (LODs) and the limits of quantitation (LOQs) of the method were 3-15 mu g/kg and 10-50 mu g/kg, respectively. Recoveries were calculated at three levels of concentration spiked in two kinds of cosmetics (skin care cream and water). The values were found between 93.8% and 121.0% with relative standard deviation (RSD) values of 2.5-7.2% for intra-day precision (n = 6) and 3.3-6.7% for inter-day precision (n = 5). The method was successfully applied to analyze twenty-two cosmetics samples and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) was detected in one sample with the concentration of 207 mu g/kg. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"As construction projects are becoming more complex and uncertain, and there is an increased focus on sustainability and green building, partnering is a way of enabling a non-adversarial environment. This creates a flexible process that helps e. g. retrofit projects achieving their goals. The purpose of this paper is to identify key elements that ensure the success of partnering projects for the different stakeholders. This paper will seek to answer the following questions: What elements are used in partnering projects? Is there a link between the use of the different partnering elements and the project's success seen from the client, contractor and user perspective? The research is carried out as a review of partnering literature, as well as an investigation of 10 partnering projects within the Norwegian context, using a case study approach. The investigated projects were both new buildings and retrofittings. A preliminary survey with additional in-depth, semi-structured interviews of clients and contractors was conducted. A document study was also carried out as a supplement to the survey and interviews. Key partnering elements such as early involvement, value-based procurement and start-up workshop were identified through this study. Further analysis revealed that these partnering elements, in combination with soft elements such as trust, commitment and competence, help facilitate success for stakeholders. The identified key partnering elements gives practitioners an implication of which partnering elements should be implemented to achieve project success and more sustainable buildings.

"Affinity tags are vital tools for the production of high-throughput recombinant proteins. Several affinity tags, such as the hexahistidine tag, maltose-binding protein, streptavidin-binding peptide tag, calmodulin-binding peptide, c-Myc tag, glutathione S-transferase and FLAG tag, have been introduced for recombinant protein production. The fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of the IgG1 antibody is one of the useful affinity tags that can facilitate detection, purification and localization of proteins and can improve the immunogenicity, modulatory effects, physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties of proteins. Fc recombinant forms a group of recombinant proteins called Fc-fusion proteins (FFPs). FFPs are widely used in drug discovery, drug delivery, vaccine design and experimental research on receptor-ligand interactions. These fusion proteins have become successful alternatives to monoclonal antibodies for drug developments. In this review, the physicochemical, biochemical, immunological, pharmaceutical and therapeutic properties of recombinant FFPs were discussed as a new generation of bioengineering strategies.

"A range of risk factors lead to opioid use and substance-related problems (SRP) including childhood maltreatment, elevated impulsivity, and psychopathology. These constructs are highly interrelated such that childhood maltreatment is associated with elevated impulsivity and trauma-related psychopathology such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and impulsivity particularly urgency and PTSD are related. Prior work has examined the association between these constructs and substance-related problems independently and it is unclear how these multi-faceted constructs (i.e., maltreatment types and positive and negative urgency) are associated with one another and SRP. The current study used structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the relations among childhood maltreatment, trait urgency, PTSD symptoms, and SRP in a sample of individuals with a history of opioid use. An initial model that included paths from each type of childhood maltreatment, positive and negative urgency, PTSD and SRP did not fit the data well. A pruned model with excellent fit was identified that suggested emotional abuse, positive urgency, and negative urgency were directly related to PTSD symptoms and only PTSD symptoms were directly related to SRP. Furthermore, significant indirect effects suggested that emotional abuse and negative urgency were related to SRP via PTSD symptom severity. These results suggest that PTSD plays an important role in the severity of SRP. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"A high standard of newborn care, especially at a primary level, is needed to address the neonatal mortality rate in South Africa. The current approach to continuing training of health-care workers uses traditional methods of centralised teaching by formal tutors away from the place of work. This is no longer affordable, achievable or desirable, particularly in rural areas. An innovative system of self-directed learning by groups of nurses caring for mothers and their newborn infants uses specially prepared course books without the need for trainers. Using self-study supported by peer discussion groups, nurses can take responsibility for their own professional growth. This builds competence, confidence and a sense of pride. Since 1993, the Perinatal Education Programme has provided continuing learning opportunities for thousands of nurses in Southern Africa. A number of prospective trials have demonstrated that study groups can significantly improve knowledge and understanding, attitudes, clinical skills and quality of care provided to mothers and infants. A recent review of 10,000 successful participants across a wide range of provinces, ages and home languages documented the success of the project. Using a question-and-answer format to promote problem-solving, case studies, simple skills workshops and multiple choice tests, each module addresses common conditions with appropriate care practices such as thorough drying at birth, delayed cord-clamping, skin-to-skin care, breast feeding, basic resuscitation, correct use of oxygen therapy, hand-washing, blood glucose monitoring and promotion of parental bonding. The training material is now also available free of charge on an on-line website as well as being presented as e-books which can be downloaded onto personal computers, tablet readers and smart phones. This is supplemented by regular SMS text messages providing nurses with relevant 'knowledge bites'. All nurses caring for newborn infants now have easy, affordable access to continuing education which promises nationwide improvements in newborn care.

"A persistent assumption across the psychological literature is that talking and writing about one's stress is inherently more beneficial than avoiding it. This study compared the effects of these stress management strategies on personal and relational health. Two hundred and fifty-one dating individuals focused on a stressor that was a current source of rumination. Writing about one's stressor for 5 consecutive days (without talking about it) decreased anxiety the most. Talking continuously about one's stressor to a dating partner harmed the relationship more than writing about or avoiding it. The effect of talking repeatedly about one's stressor on relationship quality and brooding, however, depended upon the emotional support received from one's dating partner and the ability to reappraise (positively or neutrally) the stressor.

"A multimodal actuator is proposed to fulfil the different walking patterns of a power-assisted knee exoskeleton. With this actuator, the exoskeleton leg can realize several modes of operation, including series elastic actuation, stiff position control and energy storage and release. The energy amplification characteristics of the multimodal actuator in the series elastic mode are analysed. A dynamics model was established to study how series elasticity and the equivalent mass of transmission influence a power source, such as an electric motor. The results, in both simulation and experiment, show that series elasticity can amplify actuator power output, and the power output of a multi modal actuator is greater when the equivalent mass of the transmission mechanism is smaller. This research into multimodal actuator energy amplification supplies important insights into the design of artificial systems that can more closely approximate the performance of biological systems.

"A new systematic design procedure for square-root-domain (rootx-domain) circuits, which is based on the signal flow graph (SFG) synthesis approach, is introduced in this paper. The SFG of the prototype system is modified, using a proposed set of operators, in such a way that rootx--domain building blocks could be used for the corresponding implementations. For this purpose, new rootx-domain integrator circuits have been proposed which were constructed from new current-mode geometric-mean and multiplier/divider circuits. The main advantages of the proposed circuits are the accuracy due to its immunity to the body effect, low circuit complexity and potential for low-voltage operation. As an example, a fifth-order Chebyshev low-pass filter was designed using the proposed technique. Simulation results confirm the validity of the proposed design technique and the high performance of the proposed circuits.

"Affective temperaments are the subclinical manifestations or phenotypes of mood states and hypothetically represent one healthy end of the mood disorder spectrum. However, there is a scarcity of studies investigating the neurobiological basis of affective temperaments. One fundamental aspect of temperament is the behavioral reactivity to environmental stimuli, which can be effectively evaluated by use of cognitive event-related potentials (ERPs) reflecting the diversity of information processing. The aim of the present study is to explore the associations between P300 and the affective temperamental traits in healthy individuals. We recorded the P300 ERP waves using an auditory oddball paradigm in 50 medical student volunteers (23 females, 27 males). Participants' affective temperaments were evaluated using the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego-auto questionnaire version (TEMPS-A). In bivariate analyses, depressive temperament score was significantly correlated with P300 latency (r(s) = 0.37, P < .01). In a multiple linear regression analysis, P300 latency showed a significant positive correlation with scores of depressive temperament ( = 0.40, P < .01) and a significant negative one with scores of cyclothymic temperament ( = -0.29, P = .03). Affective temperament scores were not associated with P300 amplitude and reaction times. These results indicate that affective temperaments are related to information processing in the brain. Depressive temperament may be characterized by decreased physiological arousal and slower information processing, while the opposite was observed for cyclothymic temperament.

"A wind velocity power spectrum (WVPS) with high fidelity is extremely important for accurate prediction of structural buffeting response. WVPS heavily depends on the geographical locations, local terrains and topographies. Hence, field measurement of wind characteristics may be the unique way to obtain the accurate WVPS for a specific region. In this paper, a systematic analysis and discussions of existing WVPSs were performed. Six recorded strong wind data from the structural health monitoring systems (SHMS) of Runyang Suspension Bridge (RSB) and Sutong Cable-stayed Bridge (SCB) in Jiangsu Province of China were selected for analysis. The measured and pre-processed wind velocity data was first transformed from time domain to frequency domain to obtain the measured spectrum. The spectrum for each strong wind was then fitted using the nonlinear least square method and compared with both the fitted spectrum from statistical analysis and the recommended spectrum in specifications. The modified Kaimal spectrum was proved to be the ""best"" choice for the coastal area of East Jiangsu Province. Finally, a suitable WVPS formula fit for the coastal area of East Jiangsu Province was presented based on the modified Kaimal spectrum. Results in this study provide a more accurate and reliable WVPS for wind-resistant design of engineering structures in the coastal area of East Jiangsu Province.

"A novel type of short monopole antenna is proposed. Its structure consists of a periodically slotted coaxial line radiating in linear polarization (LP). The structure can be easily modified by the addition of a thin layer of dipoles in order to generate circular polarization (CP). The number of slots along the structure, their periodicity and the tuning of the terminating load allow control of the antenna main beam' angle and width. One advantage of the proposed design over conventional monopoles is that the antenna does not require a ground plane. Both left-hand and right-hand CP are possible with the same design, simply by inverting the symmetry of the printed dipoles. Design details for the annular slotted coaxial line and for the LP and CP mast antennas are given. Prototypes in both LP and CP were fabricated and their characteristics were measured.

"A new approach, based in part on diffusive equilibrium, has been developed to model the dynamic H+ content of plsmaspheric magnetic flux tubes. Called the Global Plasmasphere lonosphere Density (GPID) model, its aim is to reproduce the main dynamic features of the more complete Field Line Interhemispheric Plasma (FLIP) model, with a simpler formulation that allows for more rapid computation of the ions temporal variation in a magnetic flux tube. By simultaneously modelling several thousand flux tubes, a global representation of the plasmasphere can be obtained in a realistic time frame. A global model allows the plasmaspheric contribution to the Total Electron Content (TEC), measured from Global Position System (GPS) satellite radio signals, to be determined and removed, hence permitting the underlying ionosphere to be observed. This paper presents the approach used to model a single magnetic flux tube. GPID assumes an lonosphere/plasmasphere composition of O+ and H+, and includes chemical processes and simple diffusive transport. In almost all situations, GPID reproduces the predictions of the FLIP model. Comparisons between GPID and the refilling fluxes obtained from whistler observations generally show good agreement, both in diurnal variations and during prolonged refilling of empty flux tubes. Comparisons to seasonal variations during solar maximum at L = 2.5 show good agreement with observations, but at solar minimum there is variable agreement. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

"Although the introduction of commercial RGB-D sensors has enabled significant progress in the visual navigation methods for mobile robots, the structured-light-based sensors, like Microsoft Kinect and Asus Xtion Pro Live, have some important limitations with respect to their range, field of view, and depth measurements accuracy. The recent introduction of the second- generation Kinect, which is based on the time-of-flight measurement principle, brought to the robotics and computer vision researchers a sensor that overcomes some of these limitations. However, as the new Kinect is, just like the older one, intended for computer games and human motion capture rather than for navigation, it is unclear how much the navigation methods, such as visual odometry and SLAM, can benefit from the improved parameters. While there are many publicly available RGB-D data sets, only few of them provide ground truth information necessary for evaluating navigation methods, and to the best of our knowledge, none of them contains sequences registered with the new version of Kinect. Therefore, this paper describes a new RGB-D data set, which is a first attempt to systematically evaluate the indoor navigation algorithms on data from two different sensors in the same environment and along the same trajectories. This data set contains synchronized RGB-D frames from both sensors and the appropriate ground truth from an external motion capture system based on distributed cameras. We describe in details the data registration procedure and then evaluate our RGB-D visual odometry algorithm on the obtained sequences, investigating how the specific properties and limitations of both sensors influence the performance of this navigation method.

In the paper, the ability of thermo-water sensitive CSMF was first time investigated for animal hairs, the structural and molecular networks for net-points and switches were therefrom identified. Experimentally, animal hair manifested a high ability of shape fixation in thermal processing and good shape recovery by water stimulus. Characterizations of two stimuli (heating and hydration) were performed systematically on hair's deformation, recovery, viscoelasticity and chemical components (crystalline phase, key bonds inamorphous area). The variations of related chemical components in molecular networks were also explored. A hybrid structural network model was thereafter proposed to interpret the thermo-water sensitive CSMF of hair.

This approach permits simultaneous solution of any number of 2-D Cartesian and axisymmetric problems by considering the electrical terminals of each finite-element model as nonnatural elements of the modified nodal analysis, allowing their systematic incorporation into the global system of equations. This way, arbitrary electrical network topologies can be readily analyzed, where the magnetic systems are no more than simple elements of the circuit system. Moreover, a unified building block is introduced for the 2-D and axisymmetric models, leading to easy computer implementation. The effectiveness of our formulation is tested by determining the electromagnetic behavior of a double-squirrel cage induction motor that is connected to three feeding transformers. A 2-D Cartesian finite-element model is employed for the three-phase motor, whereas an axisymmetric representation is used for each transformer. Hence, four finite-element models are simultaneously solved, which are electrically coupled through circuit elements. Lumped circuit parameters model the end effects of the motor squirrel cage and stator as well as the associated stator feeding circuits. Previous work only considers coupling of Cartesian systems, while our formulation expands the capabilities of quasi-3-D finite-element modeling by systematically coupling 2-D and axisymmetric finite-element models.

"A number of previous studies have reported a potential risk of malignancy, particularly hematological malignancy, developing in patients receiving a metal-on-metal (MoM) hip replacement. We report a case of malignant lymphoma that arose in a patient who had an MoM hip arthroplasty complicated by development of a pseudotumour. The tumour was a B cell follicular lymphoma that involved lymph nodes and bone. Metal ions are known to have a genotoxic effect on lymphoid cells. Although epidemiological studies have not established that there is an increased risk of lymphoma associated with MoM implants, only a relatively short time period has elapsed since re-introduction of this type of implant and long-term follow-up of patients with MoM implants is indicated.

"A pumped storage unit (PSU) is more difficult to control compared to a conventional hydropower generation unit due to the frequent switching of working conditions and the S-shaped characteristics of pump turbine. The traditional proportional integral derivative (PID) controller typically cannot easily provide high quality control. To overcome these difficulties, a fractional-order PID (FOPID) controller is designed for a PSU in this study. Although the FOPID controller is more effective compared to the traditional PID controller, it is more complex to optimize the parameters of this controller for a pump turbine governing system (PTGS). Thus, a gravitational search algorithm combined with the Cauchy and Gaussian mutation, named as CGGSA, is proposed and used to optimize the FOPID controller parameters. The experimental results indicate that the CGGSA has shown excellent optimization ability compared with some popular meta-heuristics on benchmark functions. Results have also proved that the FOPID-CGGSA controller shows significant advantages over other PID-type controllers with different optimization strategies. Meanwhile the optimally designed controller has shown great potential to improve the control quality of PTGS under multiple water heads. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"A history of ever-smoking appears to be associated with a more severe disease phenotype in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). However, evidence is sparse for the effect of increased smoking exposure on disease outcomes or whether smoking reduction or cessation improves outcomes. The aim of this study was to explore whether a dose-response relationship exists between pack-years and disease activity and functional impairment in axSpA. Consecutive patients meeting ASAS criteria for axial SpA were recruited from a spondyloarthritis service. The associations between pack-years of smoking and: (1) disease activity (BASDAI/ASDAS), (2) spinal pain, (3) functional impairment (BASFI) and (4) inflammatory markers were explored using multivariable linear models, adjusted for age, gender and use of TNF inhibition (TNFi) therapy. Pack-years were categorised into four groups (40) and analysed with light smoking (40, beta = 2.6 (0.54, 3.56)), higher BASFI (21-40, beta = 2.1 (0.42, 4.80); >40, beta = 3.2 (0.76, 5.71)), and higher ASDAS (21-40, beta = 0.82 (0.14, 1.51)). This cross-sectional study demonstrated that smoking is associated with increased axSpA severity markers in a dose-response manner. Particular effort should be made to restrict smoking exposure early before accruing a significant number of pack-years.

"Airports ask for environmental, social and economic sustainability instances as the core of the project development. The project design must focus on the role of sustainability taking into account new performance's classes to face higher levels of building resilience to the changing climate effects. Airports need to adopt long-term strategic approach to address the need of adaptation to the climate change and mitigation of impacts on the environment. This will require new designs and materials for future airport infrastructure and retrofitting of the existing ones. The paper reports ongoing research analysis of a broad study focused on the evaluation of the project compliance with the green building requirements and the definition of technological strategies for climate change adaptation. The correct identification and evaluation of climate sensitivities enable to prioritize adaptive responses. It also creates new opportunities for airport authorities and operators to anticipate the consequences of project changing conditions during operation using sustainable strategies to enhance building resilience. European and international airports examples and case studies are presented in this paper in order to illustrate the good practices and methods already adopted for assessing and minimising the risk of climate change and to formulate a proposal for the design of airports for the future.

The model of the observer is developed in the Laplace domain and represents an original approach with respect to state-of-art proposals, normally employing a state-space representation. This allows a more intuitive but equivalent design of the observer's gains, based on the standard frequency response, as compared with eigenvalues analysis. Moreover steady-state errors are obtained from a theoretical point-of-view, including the effects of the most common nonidealities affecting the drive system and parameters sensitivity. Full simulation and experimental characterization of the sensorless drive is provided with reference to a general purpose industrial drive, i.e., both in transient and steady-state and in the most meaningful speed/torque operating conditions.

"A diagnostic approach of myeloproliferative neoplasms, according to the 2008 WHO classification system for hematological malignancies, has to consider clinical, molecular, and cytogenetic information as well as bone marrow histology. A diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia requires the presence of BCR-ABL-1, and the Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-1-negative) myeloproliferative neoplasms constitute three main subtypes, including primary myelofibrosis, polycythemia rubra vera, and essential thrombocythemia. These three Ph-1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms share many pathogenic characteristic such as JAK2 mutations; however, they differ in prognosis, progression to myelofibrosis, and risk of leukemic transformation. There are currently various major points of interest in bone marrow examination in myeloproliferative neoplasms. One is the morphology of megakaryocytes, which are the hallmark of Ph-1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms and play a crucial role in separating the different subtypes of myeloproliferative neoplasms. Another is reticulin fibrosis or collagen fibrosis, which may only be detected on a bone marrow biopsy specimen by reticulin and trichrome stains, respectively, and immunohistochemistry and certain molecular techniques may be applied in bone marrow biopsies as supporting evidence of certain features of myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Sleep and regular exercise have been shown to affect brain and cognitive functions, and we investigated the interplay between these two factors on working memory. One hundred participants completed a sleep-exercise log, wore an acti-watch for five days and performed a working memory task on the sixth day. Regular exercisers were found to have significantly faster response time on the working memory task than non-regular exercisers, and such effect was moderated by actigraphy-measured total sleep time. In other words, regular exercisers had faster reaction time than non-regular exercisers only when they had sufficient sleep (>6.5hours). Our findings showed that both healthy sleep and regular exercise habits should be promoted among adolescents and young adults to optimize cognitive development.

"An enormous growth in internet usage has resulted into great amounts of digital data to handle. Data sharing has become significant and unavoidable. Data owners want the data to be secured and perennially available. Data protection and any violations thereby become crucial. This work proposes a traitor identification system which securely embeds the fingerprint to provide protection for numeric relational databases. Digital data of numeric nature calls for preservation of usability. It needs to be done so by achieving minimum distortion. The proposed insertion technique with reduced time complexity ensures that the fingerprint inserted in the form of an optimized error leads to minimum distortion. Collusion attack is an integral part of fingerprinting and a provision to mitigate by avoiding the same is suggested. Robustness of the system against several attacks like tuple insertion, tuple deletion etc. is also depicted.

"Aiming at machine learning applications in which fast online learning is required, we develop a variant of the Least Squares SVR (LSSVR) model that can learn incrementally from data and eventually provide a sparse solution vector. This is possible by incorporating into the LSSVR model the sparsification mechanism used by the kernel RLS (KRLS) model introduced in Engel et al., 2004. The performance of the resulting model, henceforth referred to as the online sparse LSSVR (OS-LSSVR) model, is comprehensively evaluated by computer experiments on several benchmarking datasets (including a large scale one) covering a number of challenging tasks in nonlinear time series prediction and system identification. Convergence, efficiency and error bounds of the OS-LSSVR model are also addressed. The results indicate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the state of the art in kernel adaptive filtering algorithms, by providing more sparse solutions with smaller prediction errors and smaller norms for the solution vector.

The aims of this study were to evaluate these risks in such patients, to determine the risk factors and finally to set some recommendations. Methods It is a cross-sectional study about 180 patients with known and treated adrenal insufficiency. The patients responded to a 14-item questionnaire concerning their knowledge about the disease and fasting during the last month of Ramadan. Results There were 132 women and 48 men. The mean age was 47.6 +/- 15.0 years (14-79). One hundred and thirty eight patients (76.7 %) were advised by their physician not to fast. Ninety-one patients (50.5 %) tried to fast. Complications occurred in 61 cases (67.0 %): asthenia in 88.5% of cases, intense thirst in 32.8 %, symptoms of dehydration in 49.2% and symptoms of hypoglycaemia in 18 %. One patient was hospitalized. Fifty-five patients (60.4 %) were able to fast for the whole month. Age, gender, duration of the disease, its primary origin, associated hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, hypertension or diabetes insipidus and daily dose of hydrocortisone did not significantly differ between fasters and non-fasters, full-month-fasters and partial-month-fasters, and fasters with complications and fasters without complications. The frequency of adequate knowledge about the disease was significantly higher in full-month-fasters vs. partial-month-fasters, and in fasters without complications vs. those with complications. Conclusion In patients with adrenal insufficiency, fasting can cause complications especially if the level of knowledge about the disease is low.

"Ambient Intelligence systems require a natural and personalized experience in interacting with services provided by the environment. In this view, the interaction may happen either in a pervasive way, through a combination of devices embedded in the environment, or using a conversational interface acting as an environment concierge. In the latter case, the interface can be embodied in a conversational agent able to involve users in a human-like conversation and to establish a social relation with them. Developing such an Ambient Conversational System (ACS) requires a model of the user that considers not only the cognitive ingredients of his mental state, but also extra-rational factors such as affect, engagement, attitudes. This paper describes a multimodal framework for recognizing the social attitude of users during the interaction with an embodied agent in a smart environment. In particular, we started from the analysis and annotation of advisory dialogs between humans and then we used the annotated corpus to build a framework for recognizing the social attitude in multimodal dialogs with an ACS. Results of the study show an acceptable performance of the framework in recognizing and monitoring the social attitude during the dialog with anACS. We also compared results of the analysis of human-human interactions with respect to the human-ACS interaction and, even if the level of initiative of subjects during the dialog was lower in this lattermodality, the difference in the average number of social moves was not significant, thus showing that subjects probably were keen to establish a social relation with the conversational agent.

"(L)-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine ((L)-DOPA) remains the primary pharmacological agent for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the development of (L)-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) limits the long-term use of (L)-DOPA for PD patients. Some data have reported that adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R) antagonists prevented LID in animal model of PD. However, the mechanism in which adenosine A(2A)R blockade alleviates the symptoms of LID has not been fully clarified. Here, we determined to knock out (KO) the gene of A(2A)R and explored the possible underlying mechanisms implicated in development of LID in a mouse model of PD. A(2A)R gene KO mice were unilaterally injected into the striatum with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in order to damage dopamine neurons on one side of the brain. 6-OHDA-lesioned mice were then injected once daily for 21 days with (L)-DOPA. Abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) were evaluated on days 3, 8, 13, and 18 after (L)-DOPA administration, and real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 and GAD67 were performed. We found that A(2A)R gene KO was effective in reducing AIM scores and accompanied with decrease of striatal GAD67, rather than GAD65. These results demonstrated that the possible mechanism involved in alleviation of AIM symptoms by A(2A)R gene KO might be through reducing the expression of striatal GAD67.

"Accurate 3D measuring systems thrive in the past few years. Most of them are based on laser scanners because these laser scanners are able to acquire 3D information directly and precisely in real time. However, comparing to the conventional cameras, these kinds of equipment are usually expensive and they are not commonly available to customers. Moreover, laser scanners interfere easily with each other sensors of the same type. On the other hand, computer vision-based 3D measuring techniques use stereo matching to acquire the cameras' relative position and then estimate the 3D location of points on the image. Because this kind of systems needs additional estimation of the 3D information, systems with real time capability often relies on heavy parallelism that prevents implementation on mobile devices. Inspired by the structure from motion systems, we propose a system that reconstructs sparse feature points to a 3D point cloud using a mono video sequence so as to achieve higher computation efficiency. The system keeps tracking all detected feature points and calculates both the amount of these feature points and their moving distances. We only use the key frames to estimate the current position of the camera in order to reduce the computation load and the noise interference on the system. Furthermore, for the sake of avoiding duplicate 3D points, the system reconstructs the 2D point only when the point shifts out of the boundary of a camera. In our experiments, we show that our system is able to be implemented on tablets and can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with a denser point cloud with high speed.

"A new intelligent hybrid structure used for online tuning of a PID controller is proposed in this paper. The structure is based on two adaptive neural networks, both with built-in Chebyshev orthogonal polynomials. First substructure network is a regular orthogonal neural network with implemented artificial endocrine factor (OENN), in the form of environmental stimuli, to its weights. It is used for approximation of control signals and for processing system deviation/disturbance signals which are introduced in the form of environmental stimuli. The output values of OENN are used to calculate artificial environmental stimuli (AES), which represent required adaptation measure of a second network orthogonal endocrine adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (OEANFIS). OEANFIS is used to process control, output and error signals of a system and to generate adjustable values of proportional, derivative, and integral parameters, used for online tuning of a PID controller. The developed structure is experimentally tested on a laboratory model of the 3D crane system in terms of analysing tracking performances and deviation signals (error signals) of a payload. OENN-OEANFIS performances are compared with traditional PID and 6 intelligent PID type controllers. Tracking performance comparisons (in transient and steady-state period) showed that the proposed adaptive controller possesses performances within the range of other tested controllers. The main contribution of OENN-OEANFIS structure is significant minimization of deviation signals (17%-79%) compared to other controllers. It is recommended to exploit it when dealing with a highly nonlinear system which operates in the presence of undesirable disturbances. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"A cross-sectional reliability study was conducted with 23 normal participants to establish normal values, and the repeatability and validity of distal radioulnar joint translation measurements using ultrasound imaging. Static transverse images of maximal supination, neutral and maximal pronation were examined to assess translation, using a method consistent with the rheumatoid arthritis subluxation ratio. Translation while gripping a 1kg weight in supinated and pronated positions was then compared with non-gripping translation. There was significantly more ulnar radial translation found with pronation than supination, when compared with neutral. Gripping in pronation did not produce statistically significant changes in translation, whereas the changes produced by gripping in supination were significant. Internal consistency was deemed very high and the rheumatoid arthritis subluxation ratio values measured using ultrasound imaging were consistent with previously documented values measured by computerized tomography. This study demonstrated that translational movement of the distal radioulnar joint can be reliably detected in healthy participants using ultrasound imaging. This may reduce dependency on other imaging modalities to diagnose distal radioulnar joint instability. Level of Evidence: 2.

In her seminal paper, Cohen [8, JACM 2000] introduced the notion of hopsets in the context of parallel computation of approximate shortest paths, and since then it has found numerous applications in various other settings, such as dynamic graph algorithms, distributed computing, and the streaming model. Cohen [8] devised efficient algorithms for constructing hopsets with polylogarithmic in n number of hops. Her constructions remain the state-of-the-art since the publication of her paper in STOC'94, i.e., for more than two decades.

The varicap diode interconnected with sharp metal shank via operational amplifier (op-amp) was electrically linked to the corresponding split-type reflectors on a one-port SAW reflective delay line. A 4.3 nH inductor was also placed in between the split-type reflector on one-port SAW reflective delay line and varicap diode to obtain a large linearity and high sensitivity through impedance matching effect. As electrical pulses imitating neural signals were applied to the sharp metal shanks, overall impedance perturbations between the split-type reflector and external varicap diode under reverse bias were observed, giving rise to amplitude changes in the reflection peaks in the time domain depending on the magnitude of the electrical pulses. Good linearity and sensitivity were observed at the amplitude variations in terms of electrical pulses.

The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and flood histogram quality at different bias voltages (27.5 V to 32.0 V at 0.5 V intervals) and a fixed temperature of 0 degrees C were evaluated by coupling a 6 x 6 array of 1.3 mm x 1.3 mm x 20 mm polished LSO crystals to the center of the PS-SSPM array. The timing resolution was measured at a fixed bias voltage of 31.0 V and a fixed temperature of 0 degrees C. All the measurements were evaluated and compared using capacitors with different values and tolerances. Capacitor values ranged from 0.051 nf to 10 nf, and the capacitance tolerance ranged from 1% to 20%. The results show that better performance was achieved using capacitors with smaller values and better capacitance tolerance. Using 0.2 nf capacitors, the SNR, energy resolution and timing resolution were 24.3, 18.2% and 8.8 ns at a bias voltage 31.0 V, respectively. The flood histogram quality was also evaluated by using a 10 x 10 array of 1 mm x 1 mm x 10 mm polished LSO crystals and a 10 x 10 array of 0.7 mm x 0.7 mm x 20 mm unpolished LSO crystals to determine the smallest crystal size resolvable. These studies showed that the high spatial resolution of the PS-SSPM was preserved allowing for 0.7 mm crystals to be identified. These results show that the capacitive charge-division analog signal processing method can significantly reduce the number of electronic channels, from 20 to 5, while retaining the excellent performance of the detector.

"Academics in higher education institutions often experience the conflicting demands of teaching, research and administration. With the growth of online education these staff are frequently required to design, develop, teach, facilitate and, in some cases, administer online courses. Cumulatively these additional tasks challenge academics, not only in terms of the personal professional development but also in accommodating the range of tasks expected of them. This paper reports the findings of a study which investigated the lived experience of construction management academics teaching at universities in Australia. The study adopted a lived experience research approach that enabled the lives of construction management academics to be investigated through the collection of a mixture of qualitative and quantitative data. The study provides empirical evidence of a range of challenges facing those delivering online courses. Recommendations for online teachers and online course designers emerged from this study with application to both faculty-based and institution-wide practices. The findings are relevant to those in the higher education sector who are involved in online teaching, course design for online delivery and professional development related to online initiatives.

"Acoustophoresis, the ability to acoustically manipulate particles and cells inside a microfluidic channel, is a critical enabling technology for cell-sorting applications. However, one of the major impediments for routine use of acoustophoresis at clinical laboratory has been the reliance on the inherent physical properties of cells for separation. Here, we present a microfluidic-based microBubble-Activated Acoustic Cell Sorting (BAACS) method that rely on the specific binding of target cells to microbubbles conjugated with specific antibodies on their surface for continuous cell separation using ultrasonic standing wave. In acoustophoresis, cells being positive acoustic contrast particles migrate to pressure nodes. On the contrary, air-filled polymer-shelled microbubbles being strong negative acoustic contrast particles migrate to pressure antinodes and can be used to selectively migrate target cells. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate the separation of cancer cell line in a suspension with better than 75% efficiency. Moreover, 100% of the microbubble-cell conjugates migrated to the anti-node. Hence a better upstream affinity-capture has the potential to provide higher sorting efficiency. The BAACS technique expands the acoustic cell manipulation possibilities and offers cell-sorting solutions suited for applications at point of care.

"A genome-wide association study identified GAB2 rs2373115 to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk in European population. However, inconsistent results are reported in East Asian population. Here, we performed an updated analysis using 65,704 samples including 20,982 AD cases and 44,722 controls. First, we investigated the GAB2 rs2373115 variant in Asian population using 3974 AD cases and 7568 controls. To further evaluate the effect of rs2373115 in different populations, we selected 17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls in European population. We used three genetic models, and found no significant heterogeneity in Asian population. A fixed effect model analysis showed no significant association between rs2373115 and AD in Asian population. There was no significant heterogeneity in the pooled East Asian and European populations. The fixed effect model analysis again showed no significant association between rs2373115 and AD in these pooled populations. Taken together, these findings suggest that GAB2 rs2373115 may contribute to AD susceptibility only in European population but not in East Asian population. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The theoretical principle of the nonlinear treatment is exposed, and the analytical model of an electrical generator a is developed. The results given by the model are compared to those of an experimental set-up. Experimental results C show that the extracted electrical energy may be increased beyond 400%.

Nowadays, in-depth study and exploration are conducted for fractal in almost all domains of science; some architects have paid attention to it in contemporary architecture design and gained some enlightenment. In the current parametric architecture design, only computer programming means is introduced into traditional architecture design, and various complicated forms that surpass the traditional and modern buildings will be presented before us. Its development has drawn more and more attention. Based on the latest nonlinear mathematical theory of fractal geometry, this paper generates multiple 3D model prototypes for selection by applying nonlinear IFS, and further processes the models into design schemes of fractal architecture.

"A common approach to model memristive systems is to include empirical window functions to describe edge effects and nonlinearities in the change of the memristance. We demonstrate that under quite general conditions, each window function can be associated with a sigmoidal curve relating the normalised time-dependent memristance to the time integral of the input. Conversely, this explicit relation allows us to derive window functions suitable for the mesoscopic modelling of memristive systems from a variety of well-known sigmoidals. Such sigmoidal curves are defined in terms of measured variables and can thus be extracted from input and output signals of a device and then transformed to its corresponding window. We also introduce a new generalised window function that allows the flexible modelling of asymmetric edge effects in a simple manner. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

"After implantation of a biomaterial, an inflammatory response involving macrophages is induced. The behavior of macrophages depends on their phenotype, and by directing macrophage polarization. unwanted effects may be avoided. In this study, the possibility to modulate the behavior of macrophages activated by biomaterials. was assessed in an in vitro model. Primary human monocytes were seeded on polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene and polylactic acid yarns, and treated with medications frequently used by patients: rapamycin, dexamethasone, celecoxib or pravastatin. Modulation of the adhering macrophages with rapamycin resulted in a generally pro-inflammatory effect. Dexamethasone caused an overall anti-inflammatory effect on the macrophages cultured on either material, while celecoxib only affected macrophages adhering to polyethylene terephthalate and polylactic acid. Pravastatin increased the. pro-inflammatory genes of macrophages cultured on polypropylene and polylactic acid. Pairwise comparison revealed that macrophages adhering to polylactic acid seemed to be more susceptible to phenotype modulation than when adhering to polypropylene or polyethylene terephthalate. The. data show. that macrophages activated by the biomaterials can be modulated, yet the degree of the modulatory capacity depends on the type of material. Combined, this model provides insights into the possibility of using a medication in combination with a biomaterial to direct macrophage behavior and thereby possibly avoid. unwanted effects after implantation.

"Alarm management is a fast-growing and important aspect in the petroleum operation domain. Alarm devices have become very cheap leading petroleum equipment manufacturers to overuse them transferring safety responsibility to operators. Not rarely, accident reports cite poor operators understanding of the actual plant status due to too many active alarms. Typical alarms for a process plant could average over fourteen thousand per day so, there is mandatory to have a filtering process to distinguish expected from non-expected behavior during emergency scenarios. Ambient Intelligence contributes by enriching the petroleum plant environment with technology (mainly sensors and devices interconnected through a network) and built a system to help plant operators to make decisions based on real-time information gathered and historical data accumulated. Ambient Intelligence puts together all these resources to provide flexible and intelligent services to users acting in their environment. Inspired by the distributed and encapsulated aspect of the process plant artifact physical model, we proposed a multi-agent-based alarm management system to synthesize the process plant situation during emergency situations and assisting operators to make sense of alarm avalanche scenarios.

"A numerical model was used to investigate the mechanical behaviour of granular embankments reinforced by geosynthetics in areas prone to subsidence and to overcome the shortcomings of the current design methods. The ability of the numerical model to consider the load transfer mechanisms and the deflection of the geosynthetic was established by comparison with experimental data. By testing two numerical processes, it was demonstrated that the cavity opening modes have a great influence on the shape of the load distribution transmitted to the geosynthetic sheet above the cavity and on the expansion mechanisms of the soil. An approximate conical load distribution seems well adapted when considering a progressive cavity diameter opening process, whereas an inverted load distribution seems more suitable for a gradual settlement process. In both cases, the intensity of the load transfer mechanism can be approached by the Terzaghi's formulation using an appropriate value for the ratio between the horizontal and vertical stresses. Finally, recommendations based on the experimental and numerical results are proposed to promote a better design of such structures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Numerous independent automated innovations are intimated in the lives of individuals making their work much easier. It has been seen that automated vehicles are presented so far, with shrewd abilities after enormous measures of cash spent yearly on the examination. Here in this paper, autonomous maze solving robot is developed with independent mapping and localization skill. Firstly, the maze solving vehicle is designed with three infrared sensors of which two is used for wall detection to avoid collision and the third is for obstacle detection for picking and placing the objects to clear its pathway with the help of robotic arm. Also, it desires to use robot where an environment unreachable for human. In addition, there are also places where use of robots is the only way to achieve a goal. For this, appropriate placement of sensory devices is very critical. We have successfully implemented a maze solving ability onto the robot so called MazeBot.

"Although vision-based methods for displacement and vibration monitoring have been used in civil engineering for more than a decade, most of these techniques require physical targets attached to the structures. This requirement makes computer vision-based monitoring for real-life structures cumbersome due to need to access certain critical locations. In this study, a non-target computer vision-based method for displacement and vibration measurement is proposed by exploring a new type of virtual markers instead of physical targets. The key points of measurement positions obtained using a robust computer vision technique named scale-invariant feature transform show a potential ability to take the place of classical targets. To calculate the converting ratio between pixel-based displacement and engineering unit (millimetre), a practical camera calibration method is developed to convert pixel-based displacements to engineering unit since a calibration standard (a target) is not available. Methods and approaches to handle challenges such as low contrast, changing illumination and outliers in matching key points are also presented. The proposed method is verified and demonstrated on the UCF four-span bridge model and on a real-life structure, with excellent results for both static and dynamic behaviour of the two structures. Finally, the method requires a simple, less complicated and more cost-effective hardware compared to conventional displacement and vibration monitoring measuring technologies.

"Abnormal corticostriatal resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) has been implicated in the neuropathology of multiple sclerosis. The striatum, a component of the basal ganglia, is involved in diverse functions including movement, cognition, emotion, and limbic information processing. However, the brain circuits of the striatal subregions contributing to the changes in rsFC in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients remain unknown. We used six subdivisions of the striatum in each hemisphere as seeds to investigate the rsFC of striatal subregions between RRMS patients and matched healthy controls (HCs). In addition, we also scanned a subcohort of RRMS patients after an average of 7 months to test the reliability of our findings. Compared to HCs, we found significantly increased dorsal caudal putamen (DCP) connectivity with the premotor area, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), insula, precuneus, and superior parietal lobule, and significantly increased connectivity between the superior ventral striatum and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in RRMS patients following both scans. Furthermore, we found significant associations between the Expanded Disability Status Scale and the rsFC of the left DCP with the DLPFC and parietal areas in RRMS patients. Our results suggest that the DCP may be a critical striatal subregion in the pathophysiology of RRMS.

"A spatiotemporal mining framework is a novel tool for the analysis of marine association patterns using multiple remote sensing images. From data pretreatment, to algorithm design, to association rule mining and pattern visualization, this paper outlines a spatiotemporal mining framework for abnormal association patterns in marine environments, including pixel-based and object-based mining models. Within this framework, some key issues are also addressed. In the data pretreatment phase, we propose an algorithm for extracting abnormal objects or pixels over marine surfaces, and construct a mining transaction table with object-based and pixel-based strategies. In the mining algorithm phase, a recursion method to construct a direct association pattern tree is addressed with an asymmetric mutual information table, and a recursive mining algorithm to find frequent items. In the knowledge visualization phase, a ""Dimension-Attributes"" visualization framework is used to display spatiotemporal association patterns.

"Ampoule injection is a routinely used treatment in hospitals due to its rapid effect after intravenous injection. During manufacturing, tiny foreign particles can be present in the ampoule injection. Therefore, strict inspection must be performed before ampoule injections can be sold for hospital use. In the quality control inspection process, most ampoule enterprises still rely on manual inspection which suffers from inherent inconsistency and unreliability. This paper reports an automated system for inspecting foreign particles within ampoule injections. A custom-designed hardware platform is applied for ampoule transportation, particle agitation, and image capturing and analysis. Constructed trajectories of moving objects within liquid are proposed for use to differentiate foreign particles from air bubbles and random noise. To accurately classify foreign particles, multiple features including particle area, mean gray value, geometric invariant moments, and wavelet packet energy spectrum are used in supervised learning to generate feature vectors. The results show that the proposed algorithm is effective in classifying foreign particles and reducing false positive rates. The automated inspection system inspects over 150 ampoule injections per minute (versus by technologist) with higher accuracy and repeatability. In addition, the automated system is capable of diagnosing impurity types while existing inspection systems are not able to classify detected particles. Note to Practitioners-Present quality assessment of ampoule injections in pharmaceutical manufacturing relies on manual operation by certified technologists or machine-assisted detection systems. Existing technologies are not able to effectively distinguish symbols/dirt on the surface of an ampoule, air bubbles, and random noise from foreign particles inside the ampoule. This paper reports an automated ampoule inspection system consisting of two working stations (high-speed revolving station and abruptly stopping station). The system agitates particles and rotates them spirally along the axis of the ampoule container. Based on image processing and trajectories construction, foreign particles are effectively detected and distinguished from air bubbles and random noise.

"A Summary Internet search rates for ""vitamin D"" were explored using Google Trends. Search rates increased from 2004 until 2010 and thereafter displayed a seasonal pattern peaking in late winter. This knowledge could help guide the timing of public health interventions aimed at managing vitamin D deficiency. Purpose The Internet is an important source of health information. Analysis of Internet search activity rates can provide information on disease epidemiology, health related behaviors and public interest. We explored Internet search rates for vitamin D to determine whether this reflects the increasing scientific interest in this topic. Methods Google Trends is a publically available tool that provides data on Internet searches using Google. Search activity for the term ""vitamin D"" from 1st January 2004 until 31st October 2016 was obtained. Comparison was made to other bone and nutrition related terms. Results Worldwide, searches for ""vitamin D"" increased from 2004 until 2010 and thereafter a statistically significant (p < 0.001) seasonal pattern with a peak in February and nadir in August was observed. This seasonal pattern was evident for searches originating from both the USA (peak in February) and Australia (peak in August); p < 0.001 for both. Searches for the terms ""osteoporosis"", ""rickets"", ""back pain"" or ""folic acid"" did not display the increase observed for vitamin D or evidence of seasonal variation. Conclusion Public interest in vitamin D, as assessed by Internet search activity, did increase from 2004 to 2010, likely reflecting the growing scientific interest, but now displays a seasonal pattern with peak interest during late winter. This information could be used to guide public health approaches to managing vitamin D deficiency.

"A practical issue is present in sustaining and rehabilitating the ecologically vulnerable post-mining area in which the environmental condition varies spatially and therefore influenced by multiple factors. This paper attempts to integrate the ecological vulnerability assessment and rehabilitation treatment to assist land managers in revealing vulnerable features along with developing treatments of vulnerability mitigation. Using a post-mining site in a mountainous area in western China as study area, an indicator system and framework for assessing and reducing vulnerability were developed based on a vulnerability analysis. Geo-informatics, such as satellite image processing and spatial analysis, were employed to perform the assessment and planning. It was found that higher exposure and sensitivity are the main causes of increased vulnerability in a seriously disturbed post-mining area. Rehabilitation treatments were arranged spatially and structurally based on the framework of vulnerability mitigation. A pre-evaluation of the effectiveness shows this type of rehabilitation has a convergence effect that clusters and lowers the ecological vulnerability index ( EVI). The average value of EVI will be reduced by 15.02% if the minimum standards of rehabilitation can be completed. Altogether, an integration of rehabilitation treatments and the quantification of vulnerability in a spatially explicit manner are critical for planners to gain more insight into ecological vulnerability in post-mining area, which provides guidance to simplify rehabilitation planning with respect to vulnerability mitigation.

"A rail-to-rail operational amplifier is designed with minimum variation in the input stage transconductance (g(m)) in standard 0.18 mu m CMOS technology. In this design, transconductance is maintained approximately constant independent of the operation region of the input transistors (i.e., saturation or weak inversion regions). Unlike conventional methods in rail-to-rail designs in which two complementary differential pairs are used, in this work, by using a single input pair, the sensitivity to mismatches between PMOS and NMOS input transistors is eliminated. A Monte-Carlo simulation with n=300 was run to ensure mismatch insensitivity. Simulation results show that the input stage transconductance deviation as the input common-mode voltage varies from rail-to-rail is less than +/- 0.81%, in typical conditions and at 27 degrees C. When the temperature varies from -20 degrees C to 120 degrees C, the variation does not exceed +/- 1.28%. Furthermore, the variations of g(m) two long-channel (L=1 mu m) and short-channel (L=0.18 mu m) cases are +/- 0.85% and +/- 0.9%, respectively.

It can overcome the limitation of abc to dq frame transformation. However, the D-Sigma control requires four sets of control laws to cover four quadrant operations, namely, grid connection (power factor (PF) 1 similar to +/- 0.866), rectification with PF correction, PF leading (0 similar to 0.866), and PF lagging (0 similar to-0.866). Moreover, the switching sequences for the four modes are also different from each other, increasing complexity of firmware programming. In this paper, improvement of the control law derivation and region selection for the D-Sigma digital control is presented. By selecting the zero-crossing points of phase voltages as region transitions, the control laws and the related parameter tables for the four modes can be unified to a general form. The switching sequences of the four modes are also unified to the switching pattern of the grid-connectionmode. Additionally, a D-Sigma transformation matrix is identified to simplify the derivation procedure of the division (D) and summation (Sigma), which can obtain the control law directly.

"Advancements of recently developed timber products and their application within the prefabrication process require construction management processes to be standardized and unified. These processes then need to be scientifically proven with cross-company references. Apart from technical developments, especially in terms of cost savings and standardization of building procedures, professionalization also plays a fundamental role in providing practical application for a long term success in the market. The current demand for the mass appeal of timber is accompanied by various economical key factors in addition to the question of technical standardized system components, which provide long term stability regarding costs, consistent quality, construction management optimization and sustainability. According to this research paper, the integration of a consistent data workflow during the planning, production, and installation process allows for a significantly shortened construction period with major on site cost reduction as well as for a sustainable approach to delivering a holistic construction management system for timber. The identified criteria and surveyed fundamentals are used to create general construction management methods for the branch. Additionally the applicability was analyzed consistently to determine future potential and generate appropriate and integral timber building systems. Modern timber construction methods are especially suitable for prefabrication because of the material specific properties, its sustainable performance, the possibilities in prefabrication and easier assembly under dry construction conditions. For this reason a high productivity combined with excellent quality in short installation periods provides verifiable arguments for best practice examples in the area of construction management of modern timber building systems.

"123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine cardiac scintigraphy (MIBG) is a useful imaging technique for the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). However, MIBG has a serious disadvantage in that it demands a long examination time. The objective of this study was to evaluate statistically the usefulness of the heart/ mediastinum ratio (H/M) from the early phase of MIBG for the differential diagnosis of DLB. In total, 113 patients were examined, including 32 non-DLB (19 with Alzheimer's dementia) and 79 DLB patients. The mean early-H/M ratio was 2.83 in the non-DLB group and 1.95 in the DLB group. The mean delayed-H/M ratio was 3.0 in the non-DLB group and 1.76 in the DLB group. With a cutoff point of 2.27 on early images, the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were 65%, 94%, and 73%, respectively, and the area under the curve was 0.82, indicating moderate accuracy. This analysis indicates that images from the early phase of MIBG alone are sufficient for the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and DLB.

Preoperative magnetic resonance enterography was performed in all patients, following a homogeneous protocol, within the 3 months prior to surgery. A thorough exploration of the small bowel was performed during the surgical procedure; calibration spheres were used according to the discretion of the surgeon.

During surgery, 12 lesions (14.8%) that were not described on magnetic resonance enterography were found. Seven of these were detected exclusively by the use of calibration spheres, passing unnoticed at surgical exploration. Magnetic resonance enterography had 90% accuracy in detecting the location of the stenosis (75.0% sensitivity, 95.7% specificity). Magnetic resonance enterography did not precisely diagnose the presence of an inflammatory phlegmon (accuracy 46.2%), but it was more accurate in detecting abscesses or fistulas (accuracy 89.9% and 98.6%, respectively). Conclusion Magnetic resonance enterography is a useful tool in the preoperative assessment of patients with Crohn's disease. However, a thorough intraoperative exploration of the entire small bowel is still necessary.

"Arctic river icings are surface ice accumulations that can be >10km(2) in area and >10m thick. They commonly impact the hydrology, geomorphology, and ecology of Arctic river environments. Previous examination of icing dynamics in Arctic Alaska found no substantial changes in extent through 2005. However, here we use daily time series of satellite imagery for 2000-2015 to demonstrate that the temporal persistence and minimum summertime extent of large icings in part of Arctic Alaska and Canada have declined rapidly. We identified 122 large ephemeral icings, and 70 are disappearing significantly earlier in the summer, with a mean trend of -1.60.9day(-1) for fully ephemeral features. Additionally, 14 of 25 icings that usually persist through the summer have significantly smaller minimum extents (-2.61.6%yr(-1)). These declines are remarkably rapid and suggest that Arctic hydroclimatic systems generating icings, and their associated ecosystems, are changing rapidly. Plain Language Summary Liquid water emerging from groundwater and flowing through Arctic rivers during the winter often freezes into large ice features, which are called river icings. These icings, which are found in nearly all parts of the Arctic, create wide, gravelly river channels that can be important habitat for animals. When icings melt during the summer, they help keep rivers flowing when other water sources are limited. Up until now, no study has systematically looked at whether these features are changing in response to warming temperatures. We use daily satellite imagery available over northern Alaska from 2000 to 2015 in order to test whether icings are becoming smaller or disappearing earlier in the summer. Of 147 features examined, we found that 84 are either becoming smaller (for those that persist throughout the summer) or are disappearing earlier (for those that fully melt each summer). None are becoming larger or disappearing later. These changes may be directly related to warming temperatures, but they may also be happening because climate change is altering how rivers and groundwater interact. If these trends continue, we may see changes in the form of many Arctic rivers and impacts on the habitat of animals like fish and caribou.

"A numerical model and experimental validation of Compound Parabolic Concentrators (CPC) for heat generation are presented in this work. A previous model developed has been carefully revised and modified in order to generalize it. The mathematical model consists in a one-dimensional numerical model to describe the thermal and fluid-dynamic behavior of the CPC. Governing equations (continuity, momentum and energy) for the fluid flow inside the CPC absorber tube, together with the energy equation for the absorber tube wall, cover, insulation and reflector, and the thermal analysis of the solar concentrator are solved iteratively in an individually manner as the most suitable and reliable numerical strategy for numerical convergence. A prototype of CPC was used to evaluate and validate the numerical model. This consisted of a cylindrical absorber with a real concentration ratio of 1.8, acceptance angle of 30, and aperture area of 0.1764 m(2). A measurement uncertainty analysis was carried out. The mean deviation of the model against experimental data for the thermal efficiency was +/- 6.4%, for the increment of temperature was +/- 0.2 degrees C and for the pressure drop was +/- 10.7%. According to these results, a good correlation has been obtained between numerical and experimental results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"A new material from clay was developed that has a resistance to carbon dioxide flow in upstream for plugging CO2 storage wells. Thermogravimetric and thermal stability of this material showed a minimal variation in weight loss with incremental heating up to 420 degrees C. Adsorption-desorption of CO2 at various modeled temperature showed an exothermic and spontaneous process with maximum adsorption capacity of 775 mg/g obtained at 640 psi (43.5 bar) and 50 degrees C. Higher pressure led to more storage capacity with physisorption hysteresis curves. Freundlich and BET models best fit the equilibrium adsorption data with average regression coefficient of 0.995. The new material can substitute the conventional cement plugs for upstream carbon sequestration and prevents the migration of the stored CO2 through the cement plug to the surface. Also the developed new cement showed no chemical interaction which confirms the economical impact of using this cement to plug the CO2 sequestrations wells. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

"Aim Our unit has recently shown that sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) has a significantly positive short-term effect on selected patients with diarrhoea-predominant or mixed irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of the present prospective study was to evaluate the medium-term efficacy of SNS for IBS to establish whether SNS could have a future role in the treatment of IBS. Method Patients with IBS who had previously been implanted with a permanent neurostimulator as part of a randomized, controlled, crossover study, were assessed for medium-term follow-up. The primary end-point was change in the IBS-specific symptom score (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale-Irritable Bowel Syndrome version questionnaire) from baseline to 3-year follow-up. The secondary end-point was a change in the IBS-specific quality of life score (Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Impact Scale questionnaire) from baseline to 3-year follow-up. Results Of 26 patients, 20 were eligible for 3-year follow- up. The median IBS-specific symptom score was significantly lower at 3-year follow-up (30, range 1371) than at baseline (62, 45-80) (P = 0.0001). The effect was observed in all symptom clusters within the score. Also, the median IBS-specific quality of life score was significantly improved at 3-year follow-up (52, 26-169) compared with baseline (135, 82-180, P = 0.0002). The effect was observed in all domains of the score. As per the protocol, 75% of patients were judged therapeutic successes. Seventy per cent of patients had a more than 50% reduction in daily IBS symptoms. Conclusion At medium-term follow-up, SNS continues to be an effective treatment for highly selected patients with diarrhoea-predominant or mixed IBS.

"A new approach to the control of electro-magneto-mechanical system is proposed in this paper. Conventionally, these systems are controlled based on the Maxwell system model via an on-off or PID control technique, which displays acceptable performance in the low frequency region, but not in the high frequency region where position control performance is greatly degraded. In order to improve the performance, a newly developed virtual 2(nd) order system modeling technique, SSID, is adopted for a complex electro-magnetomechanical system in the study. This technique states that any unknown system exposed to a random disturbance with unknown intensity can be identified in terms of a virtual 2(nd) order system model via the inverse process of a certain stochastic analysis. As a typical hybrid system, a solenoid valve is used as the target electro-magneto-mechanical system to study the modeling of the virtual 2(nd) order system. In order to confirm the performance of the proposed control strategy, autotuning PID controller in PWM mode is utilized. Simulations based on the conventional Maxwell system model with control via the bang-bang, autotuning PID, and the proposed virtual 2(nd) order system model approaches are conducted using MATLAB Simulink. Performance of these three systems in the low and high frequency bands is also compared. The simulation results reveal that the control performance of the virtual 2(nd) order system model is much improved compared with that of the Maxwell system model under autotuning PID and bang-bang controls in both low and high frequency regions, where the error is drastically reduced to approximately 1/5 of the original value.

"A great number of people suffer from burning injuries all around the world each year. Applying an appropriate wound dressing can promote new tissue formation, prevent losing water and inhibit invasion of infectious organisms. In this study, egg white with a long standing history, as a homemade remedy, was fabricated as a wound dressing for burn injuries. For this reason, ovalbumin films were cross-linked by 1-ethyl-3-3-dimethyl aminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) with different concentrations (1,5 and 10 mM) using three concentrations of ethanol. Physical chemical characterizations including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gas transmission rate (GTR), tensile mechanical tests, water uptake and degradation rate were performed on the samples. The sample with 5 mM crosslinking agent at 70% ethanol was considered as the optimized one with 417 kPa of ultimate tensile strength, 64% elongation at break and 230% water uptake. In addition, biological evaluations conducted by MTT and live/dead assay indicated no sign of cyto-toxicity for all the samples. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the fibroblast cells were well spread on the sample with the formation of filopodia. In conclusion, modified ovalbumin can be applied as the base material for fabrication of wound dressing and skin care products. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"A corona is a layer of macromolecules formed on a nanoparticle surface in vivo. It can substantially change the biological identity of nanomaterials and possibly trigger adverse responses from the body tissues. Dissecting the role of the corona in the development of a particular disease may provide profound insights for understanding toxicity of nanomaterials in general. In our present study, we explored the capability of different silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) to induce silicosis in the mouse lung and analyzed the composition of coronas formed on these particles. We found that SiNPs of certain size and surface chemistry could specifically recruit transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1)intotheircorona, which subsequently induces the development of lung fibrosis. Once embedded into the corona on SiNPs, TGF-beta l was remarkably more stable than in its free form, and its fibrosis-triggering activity was significantly prolonged. Our study meaningfully demonstrates that a specific corona component on a certain nanoparticle could initiate a particular pathogenic process in a clinically relevant disease model. Our findings may shed light on the understanding of molecular mechanisms of human health risks correlated with exposure to small-scale substances.

"A globally convergent and fully coupled 3D inverse model for smart materials is presented. In practice, stress and field (electric, magnetic, or temperature) are applied to smart materials whereas strain and flux density (electric, magnetic, or temperature) are measured. We refer to constitutive models that follow this scheme as direct models. In certain design and control situations, however, inverse models are necessary in which the field and stress are found from specified flux density and strain. This inversion typically involves an iterative procedure, which may be prone to convergence issues. An inverse model approach is proposed for arbitrary smart materials. The inversion requirement is a continuous and second order differentiable direct model for any chosen smart material. The approach is globally convergent, which makes it ideal for use in finite element frameworks. The premise of the proposed iterative system model is to constitute a recursive correction formula based on second order approximations of a novel scalar error function which offers a faster convergence rate. A continuation approach is then used to achieve global convergence for arbitrary input parameters. Magnetostrictive Galfenol is chosen to illustrate the effectiveness of the inverse model, and compact analytical derivations of the Jacobian and Hessian matrices are presented. The convergence rate of the proposed approach is superior to that of an existing inverse model. Finally, the inverse model's robustness is demonstrated through integration of the model into a finite-element framework to simulate a magnetostrictive composite plate actuator in full 3D.

"A pi-shaped piezoelectric harvester which can be applied for using tension and vibration of cables in cable-stayed bridge and suspension bridge was proposed and the generating output characteristics were studied depending on the ceramic and the elastic body size. The harvester consists of a pi shaped elastic body and a rectangular piezoelectric ceramic which is attached on the upper surface of the elastic body. If contraction and release are given symmetrically at both ends of the elastic body legs, bending of the elastic body and the ceramic plate is occurred and electricity is generated by the piezoelectric effect of the ceramic. Structure of the pi-shaped harvester has advantage to protect the ceramic from direct pressure and vibration and it is easy to change the design by changing the position of the legs and the leg length and thickness. Generating characteristics of the harvester were analyzed by using finite element method program ANSYS. The generating characteristics of the harvester were analyzed depending on the elastic body thickness, ceramic size and the applied forces on the legs. The harvester was fabricated on the basis of the analyzed results and a frequency controllable vibrator was used to measure the output characteristics.

"A by-inspection analysis and synthesis method for multiphase switched-current (SI) circuits using signal-how graph (SFG) techniques is presented. The SFG is derived on the transistor level and the method is primarily useful for the hand analysis and design of small and medium-size SI circuits (e.g. SI filters, decimators, interpolators). Tables of commonly used SI circuits, in which the corresponding SFGs and circuits are given, make the derivation easy and fast. From the SFGs, not only the overall discrete-time transfer function, but also those in-between individual switching phases, are obtainable. With the proposed method it is straightforward to include non-ideal effects, such as finite output resistance of MOS transistors, clock-feedthrough and settling error. The method is also a useful tool for the synthesis of new SI circuits. It is shown that every low-sensitivity switched-capacitor (SC) circuit can be mapped directly into a low-sensitivity SI circuit with a corresponding topology.

"An air exposed single-chamber microbial fuel cell (SCMFC) using microalgal biocathodes was designed. The reactors were tested for the simultaneous biodegradation of real dye textile wastewater (RTW) and the generation of bioelectricity. The results of digital image processing revealed a maximum coverage area on the biocathodes by microalgal cells of 42%. The atmospheric and diffused CO2 could enable good algal growth and its immobilized operation on the cathode electrode. The biocathode-SCMFCs outperformed an open circuit voltage (OCV), which was 18%-43% higher than the control. Furthermore, the maximum volumetric power density achieved was 123.2 +/- 27.5 mW m(-3). The system was suitable for the treatment of RTW and the removal/decrease of COD, colour and heavy metals. High removal efficiencies were observed in the SCMFCs for Zn (98%) and COD (92-98%), but the removal efficiencies were considerably lower for Cr (54-80%). We observed that this single chamber MFC simplifies a double chamber system. The bio-electrochemical performance was relatively low, but the treatment capacity of the system seems encouraging in contrast to previous studies. A proof-of-concept experiment demonstrated that the microalgal biocathode could operate in air exposed conditions, seems to be a promising alternative to a Pt cathode and is an efficient and cost-effective approach to improve the performance of single chamber MFCs.

The I-V characteristic of PVG is characterized using five solar radiation dependent parameters, two of which are short circuit current and open circuit voltage of PVGs. A DC/DC converter is used as a matching circuit between the load and PVG. Selecting a suitable fixed frequency, the duty cycle (delta) of DC/DC converter has been determined adaptively by microcontroller, by getting feedback from the instantaneous value of the output voltage. As such the system is suitable for dynamic and static loads. Therefore the system needs two measurements, which are solar radiation intensity and feedback from the output voltage across the load, which are fed to microcontroller.

"A novel monobloc design of a two degree-of-freedom (DOF) compliant tool tip for a handheld powered surgical tool is presented in this paper. The monobloc tool tip can pitch and yaw using corner-filleted flexure hinge-based compliant joints and has an integrated compliant grasper. The 2DOF of the tool tip is realized by six compliant joints placed in an alternating fashion, orthogonal to each other. The tool is externally powered and consists of a drive box, a stainless steel tube, and a compliant tool tip at the distal end. The drive box houses a thumb joystick for command input, three servo actuators, and a microcontroller. The microcontroller maps surgeon's command input to the tool tip orientation and grasper actuation. By design, the graspers of the tool tip are actuated by tensile forces conveyed by the tethers, which exert a compressive load on the 2DOF compliant joints. Since the compressive load-carrying capacity of slender flexure-based compliant joints is limited, a design to enhance the compressive loadcarrying capacity of the compliant joints with a circular guide is presented. A finite-element simulation was done to verify the design of the compliant joints. Experiments were carried out to assess the relationship between the force input by the servo actuators and joint deflection. Additional experiments were carried out to determine the maximum pinching force that can be exerted by the compliant graspers. A prototype of the complete surgical tool was built to demonstrate the utility of the proposed compliant tool tip as an alternative to traditional tool tip for a handheld powered surgical tool.

"Adaptive algorithms are prevalently applied in the design of nonlinear active noise control (ANC) systems. The most important nonlinearity in ANC is the saturation effect produced by the electro-acoustical sensors and transducers. The dominant saturation nonlinearity is in the transducers, which can be represented by a Wiener model. An effective solution to mitigate such nonlinear distortion is to employ the Nonlinear Filtered-X Least Mean Square (NLFXLMS) algorithm. The controller compensates the nonlinearity using a model of the saturation effect represented by the scaled error function (SEF). However, the NLFXLMS is limited by two practical issues such that the degree of nonlinearity has to be known in advance and the SEF cannot be evaluated in real time. In this work, the NLFXLMS algorithm is modified by incorporating the tangential hyperbolic function (THF) to model the saturation effect of the loudspeaker. The proposed THF-NLFXLMS algorithm, models the nonlinear secondary path and applies the estimated degree of nonlinearity in the control algorithm design. The results show that the Wiener secondary path, with saturation nonlinearity represented by SEF, can be modelled by THF with a certain degree of accuracy and can yield a reasonable estimate of the degree of nonlinearity. The performance of the proposed algorithm is comparable with the benchmark NLFXLMS and is superior to the conventional FXLMS as well as the second order Volterra algorithm of similar computational complexity with the proposed algorithm.

"A root-zone water balance model was used to simulate the soil moisture storage of maize (Zea mays L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) fields in rainfed uplands of eastern India. The simulation study revealed that short duration (95 days) rice fields in uplands remained under ponding condition for a period of 32 days during the entire growing season. Based on the ponding depth requirement in rice fields (50 mm), excess ponding was found for seven days only out of the 32 days of ponding. In contrast, the maize field under similar length of growing season (95 days) and topographic condition could produce harvestable runoff for 23 days. Furthermore, the rice crop was to remain under moisture stress for eight days during its mid-season stage, whereas the maize was found to be without stress during entire growing season. Before sowing of winter crops, the soil moisture in the seeding zone was determined to be depleted below germination soil moisture for 18 and 19 years out of 30 years of simulation in rice and maize fields, respectively. This implies that a second crop, following withdrawal of monsoon, is not possible without pre-sowing irrigation in three out of five years in rainfed uplands. Thus, complete substitution of rice by maize in uplands would create a better scope for rainwater harvesting. Alternatively, partial replacement of rice could be a viable option for meeting both rice demand of the people and harvesting of adequate rainwater for supplemental irrigation to crops in rainy and winter seasons.

"A long-term Northern Hemisphere (NH) daily 5-km snow cover extent (SCE) product (JASMES) was developed by the application of a consistent objective snow cover mapping algorithm to data from historical optical sensors on polar orbiting satellites from 1978 to 2015. A conventional decision tree algorithm with multiple threshold tests was employed to analyze radiances for the five spectral bands available across the full analysis period. The accuracies of the analyzed SCE maps were evaluated against in-situ snow data measured at ground stations along with the SCE maps from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Data Record (NOAA-CDR) product. The evaluation showed the JASMES product to have a more temporally stable producer's accuracy (PA; 1-omission error) than NOAA, which is a key factor in the analysis of long-term SCE trends. Comparison of seasonal NH SCE trends from the two products showed NOAA to have opposite trends to those of JASMES in the fall and winter seasons, and to have overestimated SCE decreasing trends in the spring and summer. These tendencies are consistent with the increasing spatial and temporal resolutions of information over time, which were used in generating the NOAA snow analysis. An estimation of unbiased SCEs based on the accuracies of SCE maps also endorses the long-term trends of the JASMES product The JASMES NH seasonal SCE exhibited negative slopes in all seasons but was only statistically significant in the summer (JJA) and fall (SON). Delayed snow cover onset was observed to be the main driver of decreasing annual snow duration (SCD) trends. The spatial pattern of annual SCD trends exhibited noticeable asymmetry between continents, with the largest significant decreases observed over western Eurasia with relatively few statistically significant decreases over North America.

"A pineal cyst is a benign affection of the human pineal gland on the borderline between pathology and normality. Only a small percentage of patients present with symptoms and a surgical treatment is indicated in highly selected cases. A melatonin secretion in patients with a pineal cyst before and after a pineal cyst resection has not been studied yet and the effect of surgery on human metabolism is unknown. The present study examined melatonin, cortisol and blood glucose secretion profiles peri-operatively in a surgical group of 4 patients. The control group was represented by 3 asymptomatic patients with a pineal cyst. For each patient, 24-h circadian secretion curves of melatonin, cortisol and glycemia were acquired. An analysis of melatonin profiles showed an expected diurnal pattern with the night peak in patients before the surgery and in the control group. In contrast, melatonin levels in patients after the surgery were at their minimum throughout the whole 24-h period. The cortisol secretion was substantially increased in patients after the surgery. Blood glucose sampling showed no statistically significant differences. Clinical results demonstrated statistically significant headache relief measured by Visual Analogue Scale in patients after the surgery. Despite the small number of examined patients, we can conclude that patients with a pineal cyst preserved the physiological secretion of the hormone melatonin while patients who underwent the pineal cyst resection experienced a loss of endogenous pineal melatonin production, which equated with pinealectomy. Surprisingly, cortisol secretion substantially increased in patients after the surgery. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Along with the rapid advancement of digital image processing technology, image denoising remains a fundamental task, which aims to recover the original image from its noisy observation. With the explosive growth of images on the Internet, one recent trend is to seek high quality similar patches at cloud image databases and harness rich redundancy therein for promising denoising performance. Despite the well-understood benefits, such a cloud-based denoising paradigm would undesirably raise security and privacy issues, especially for privacy-sensitive image data sets. In this paper, we initiate the first endeavor toward privacy-preserving image denoising from external cloud databases. Our design enables the cloud hosting encrypted databases to provide secure query-based image denoising services. Considering that image denoising intrinsically demands high quality similar image patches, our design builds upon recent advancements on secure similarity search, Yao's garbled circuits, and image denoising operations, where each is used at a different phase of the design for the best performance. We formally analyze the security strengths. Extensive experiments over real-world data sets demonstrate that our design achieves the denoising quality close to the optimal performance in plaintext.

"Adolescent and young mothers transitioning from pregnancy to postpartum need to maintain an optimal quality of life. Stress and exposure to violence (e.g., intimate partner violence (IPV), nonpartner violence) are predictors of poor quality of life for adult women; however, these associations remain understudied among adolescent and young mothers in urban areas. Guided by the social ecological model, the current study created a latent variable, urban social stress, to examine the impact of the urban social environment (i.e., stressful life events, discrimination, family stress, and neighborhood problems) on the quality of life of adolescent and young mothers during both pregnancy and postpartum. The current study is a secondary data analysis of a prospective cohort study of 296 expectant young mothers recruited at obstetrics and gynecology clinics. Results from structural equation and multigroup models found that higher urban social stress predicted lower mental and physical quality of life during pregnancy, but these associations were significantly stronger for IPV-exposed and nonpartner violence-exposed mothers. In the postpartum period, higher urban social stress predicted lower mental and physical quality of life, but these associations were significantly stronger for IPV-unexposed and nonpartner violence-exposed mothers. Stress reduction programs need to help adolescent and young mothers in urban areas develop stress management skills specific to urban social stress. Pregnancy and parenting programs need to be tailored to the specific needs of young mothers in urban areas by becoming sensitive to the role of IPV and nonpartner violence in these young women's lives.

"All-to-all comparison problems represent a class of big data processing problems widely found in many application domains. To achieve high performance for distributed computing of such problems, storage usage, data locality and load balancing should be considered during the data distribution phase in the distributed environment. Existing data distribution strategies, such as the Hadoop one, are designed for problems with MapReduce pattern and do not consider comparison tasks at all. As a result, a huge amount of data must be re-arranged at runtime when the comparison tasks are executed, degrading the overall computing performance significantly. Addressing this problem, a scalable and efficient data distribution strategy is presented in this paper with comparison tasks in mind for distributed computing of all-to-all comparison problems. Specifically designed for problems with all-to-all comparison pattern, it not only saves storage space and data distribution time but also achieves load balancing and good data locality for all comparison tasks of the all-to-all comparison problems. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the presented approaches. It is shown that about 90% of the ideal performance capacity of the multiple machines can be achieved through using the approach presented in this paper. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"A new application of geosynthetic tube for offshore dike construction is geosynthetic mattress in which its horizontal dimension is much greater than the vertical one. This makes it more stable than the sausage shaped geosynthetic tube. However, the existing analytical or numerical methods developed for the sausage shaped geosynthetic tube may not be applicable directly to geosynthetic mattresses as the solution may not converge. In this paper, a closed-form solution was derived for a direct determination of the cross-section of geosynthetic mattress. Laboratory large scale model tests were also carried out to verify the proposed analytical method. The cross-sections of the geosynthetic mattresses obtained from the closed-form solutions agreed well with the data obtained from model tests. The tensile forces measured from the model tests were rather scattered but showed a consistent thread as those from the closed-form solutions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"A challenging task in automotive electrical traction drives is to control the speed of synchronous machines due to the existing physical and computational constraints. The goal of this paper is to find a control solution which can answer this problem. To this end, a multirate predictive cascade speed control structure suitable for real-time implementation is proposed. The focus in this paper is only on the design of the outer-loop controller. First, a suitable mathematical model for the outer-loop plant which includes also the dynamics of the inner control loop is obtained. Second, a one-step-ahead state-feedback model predictive controller based on flexible Lyapunov function concept is employed to control the rotor electrical speed. Third, a state and disturbance observer is employed to estimate the load torque and the unmeasured state. This ensures also offset-free operation of the closed-loop system. To illustrate its effectiveness, the proposed control solution is implemented in a real microcontroller and tested in real time on an industrial hardware-in-the-loop test bench and on a real traction test bench.

"An important number of academic tasks should be solved collaboratively by groups of learners. The Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) systems support this collaboration by means of shared workspaces and tools that enable communication and coordination between learners. Successful collaboration and interaction can depend on the criteria followed when forming the groups of learners. This paper proposes a method that analyses the collaboration and interaction between learners using a set of indicators or variables about how they solve academic tasks. Then, the concept of data depth is used as a measurement of the closeness of the analysis indicators' values for a learner with respect to the values that the same indicators take for the other learners. Finally, the data depth is used to form new groups of learners whose analysis indicators take similar or different values. Thus, the method enables teachers to form homogeneous and heterogeneous groups according to their preferences. This group formation process is carried out automatically by a software tool. This paper presents two case studies in which the method is applied to form groups of learners who solve academic tasks in different domains (computer programming and data mining).

"A rarely explored subject in animal research is the effect of pre-injury variables on behavioral outcome post-SCI. Low reporting of such variables may underlie some discrepancies in findings between laboratories. Particularly, intensive task-specific training before a SCI might be important, considering that sports injuries are one of the leading causes of SCI. Thus, individuals with SCI often underwent rigorous training before their injuries. In the present study, we asked whether training before SCI on a grasping task or a swimming task would influence motor recovery in rats. Swim pre-training impaired recovery of swimming 2 and 4 weeks post-injury. This result fits with the idea of motor learning interference, which posits that learning something new may disrupt learning of a new task; in this case, learning strategies to compensate for functional loss after SCI. In contrast to swimming, grasp pre-training did not influence grasping ability after SCI at any time point. However, grasp pre-trained rats attempted to grasp more times than untrained rats in the first 4 weeks post-injury. Also, lesion volume of grasp pre-trained rats was greater than that of untrained rats, a finding which may be related to stress or activity. The increased participation in rehabilitative training of the pre-trained rats in the early weeks post-injury may have potentiated spontaneous plasticity in the spinal cord and counteracted the deleterious effect of interference and bigger lesions. Thus, our findings suggest that pre-training plays a significant role in recovery after CNS damage and needs to be carefully controlled for. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"A single semester molecular biology laboratory has been developed in which students design and execute a project examining transcriptional regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Three weeks of planning are allocated to developing a hypothesis through literature searches and use of bioinformatics. Common experimental plans address a cell process and how three genes that encode for proteins involved in that process are transcriptionally regulated in response to changing environmental conditions. Planning includes designing oligonucleotides to amplify the putative promoters of the three genes of interest. After the PCR, each product is cloned proximal to b-galactosidase in a yeast reporter plasmid. Techniques used include agarose electrophoresis, extraction of DNA from agarose, plasmid purification from bacteria, restriction digestion, ligation, and bacterial transformation. This promoter/ reporter plasmid is then transformed into yeast. Transformed yeast are cultured in conditions prescribed in the experimental design, lysed and beta-galactosidase activity is measured. The course provides an independent research experience in a group setting. Notebooks are maintained on-line with regular feedback.

"A numerical framework was developed for estimating the life-cycle monetary losses (maintenance and repair costs) due to wind-induced damage on a long-span bridge. The wind loading on the bridge deck was evaluated by means of flutter derivatives (FDs), which are measured in a wind tunnel test on a section-model of the deck. These aeroelastic coefficients are random due to experimental errors. A statistical approach was employed to evaluate the effects of this uncertainty source on the wind-induced response and the damage produced on the structure. In the first part of the study ""fragility curves and surfaces"" were used to estimate the exceedance probability of representative structural performance threshold indicators by accounting for experimental errors in the estimation of FDs. These thresholds were based on deck acceleration (for user comfort) and peak deck displacements (for structural damage). In the second part the results of the initial fragility analysis were used to analyze monetary losses, produced by wind loading. The proposed model for cost analysis was adapted from an existing life-cycle simulation algorithm for earthquake hazards.

"Acne is a common skin condition with sebum overproduction, hyperkeratosis, Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) and Staphylococcus aureus, and inflammation. Punica granatum (pomegranate) is well-known for its anti-inflammatory effects; however, few studies have discussed the anti-acne effects of pomegranate. In this study, we found that pomegranate extract (PG-E) significantly reduced P. acnes-induced edema inWistar rat ears. Therefore, an evaluation platform using multiple pathogenic mechanisms of acne was established to explore the anti-acne effects of pomegranate. Results showed that PG-E inhibited bacterial growth and lipase activity. Through a bioguided-fractionation-isolation system, four hydrolysable tannins, punicalagin (1), punicalin (2), strictinin A (3), and granatin B (4), were isolated. Compounds 1 and 2 had greater anti-bacterial activities and anti-testosterone-induced HaCaT proliferative effects than the others. Compounds 1, 3, and 4 displayed lipase inhibitory effects. Compound 4 decreased cyclooxygenase-2 expression and downregulated prostaglandin E-2 production in heat-killed P. acnes-treated RAW 246.7 cells. In conclusion, PG-E is abundant in hydrolysable tannins that display multiple anti-acne capacities, including anti-bacterial, anti-lipase, anti-keratinocyte proliferation, and anti-inflammatory actions. Hence, PG-E has great potential in the application of anti-acne and skin-care products, and punicalagin (1), the most effective component in PG-E, can be employed as a quality control marker.

"Analysis of DNA sequences is a data and computational intensive problem, and therefore, it requires suitable parallel computing resources and algorithms. In this paper, we describe our parallel algorithm for DNA sequence analysis that determines how many times a pattern appears in the DNA sequence. The algorithm is engineered for heterogeneous platforms that comprise a host with multi-core processors and one or more many-core devices. For combinatorial optimization, we use the simulated annealing algorithm. The optimization goal is to determine the number of threads, thread affinities, and DNA sequence fractions for host and device, such that the overall execution time of DNA sequence analysis is minimized. We evaluate our approach experimentally using real-world DNA sequences of various organisms on a heterogeneous platform that comprises two Intel Xeon E5 processors and an Intel Xeon Phi 7120P co-processing device. By running only about 5% of possible experiments, our optimization method finds a near-optimal system configuration for DNA sequence analysis that yields with average speedup of 1.6x and 2x compared with the host-only and device-only execution.

"Acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau (ACH) is a variant of pustular psoriasis that is often very difficult to treat. Almost all anti-psoriatic agents have been used in the treatment of ACH. Ustekinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 class, is directed to the shared p40 subunit of cytokines IL-12 and IL-23. Herein, we present our experience of ustekinumab use in a 50-year-old man who was resistant to anti-tumor necrosis factor- agents. Though initial therapy with ustekinumab achieved a sustained response in our patient, after a seven months of interruption, retreatment resulted in a slower and poorer response than the initial regimen. Both responses of our patient reflects: (i) the recalcitrant chronic nature of ACH in some patients, (ii) the value of ustekinumab in ACH treatment, (iii) the fact that, as with other biologics, a loss of response may also occur with ustekinumab when the treatment is interrupted. All these data provides evidence for the fact that the course of ACH is unpredictable and possibly indicate that concerning current biologics used in the treatment of ACH, we have still failed to hit the target we aimed for.

"A notion of a universal construction suited to distributed computing has been introduced by Herlihy in his celebrated paper ""Wait-free synchronization"" (ACM Trans Program Lang Syst 13(1):124-149, 1991). A universal construction is an algorithm that can be used to wait-free implement any object defined by a sequential specification. Herlihy's paper shows that the basic system model, which supports only atomic read/write registers, has to be enriched with consensus objects to allow the design of universal constructions. The generalized notion of a k -universal construction has been recently introduced by Gafni and Guerraoui (Proceedings of 22nd international conference on concurrency theory (CONCUR'11), Springer LNCS 6901, pp 17-27, 2011). A k-universal construction is an algorithm that can be used to simultaneously implement k objects (instead of just one object), with the guarantee that at least one of the k constructed objects progresses forever. While Herlihy's universal construction relies on atomic registers and consensus objects, a k-universal construction relies on atomic registers and k-simultaneous consensus objects (which are wait-free equivalent to k-set agreement objects in the read/write system model). This paper significantly extends the universality results introduced by Herlihy and Gafni-Guerraoui. In particular, we present a k-universal construction which satisfies the following five desired properties, which are not satisfied by the previous k-universal construction: (1) among the k objects that are constructed, at least objects (and not just one) are guaranteed to progress forever; (2) the progress condition for processes is wait-freedom, which means that each correct process executes an infinite number of operations on each object that progresses forever; (3) if any of the k constructed objects stops progressing, all its copies (one at each process) stop in the same state; (4) the proposed construction is contention-aware, in the sense that it uses only read/write registers in the absence of contention; and (5) it is generous with respect to the obstruction-freedom progress condition, which means that each process is able to complete any one of its pending operations on the k objects if all the other processes hold still long enough. The proposed construction, which is based on new design principles, is called a -universal construction. It uses a natural extension of k-simultaneous consensus objects, called -simultaneous consensus objects (-SC). Together with atomic registers, -SC objects are shown to be necessary and sufficient for building a -universal construction, and, in that sense, -SC objects are -.

"After menopause, estradiol is primarily synthesized in peripheral tissues by the enzyme aromatase, encoded by CYP19A1. CYP19A1 variation associates with circulating estradiol in postmenopausal women and this variation is best represented by the intronic variant rs727479. This variation appears to have pleiotropic effects as it also associates with endometrial cancer risk. Indeed, estradiol plays an important role in the development of breast and endometrial cancer. Aromatase inhibitor (AI) drugs are used in the treatment of both diseases, however, response rates for AIs are low and there is currently no way to identify breast or endometrial cancer patients who are more likely to receive a clinical benefit. Multiple studies have proposed that genetic variation in CYP19A1 will have effects on AI efficacy: eight candidate variant studies of sample size greater than 50 describe associations between CYP19A1 variation and the outcome of patients treated with AIs. Nominally significant associations with patient outcome were reported for several variants, including rs727479. However, only an association between rs4646 and time to progression was replicated in an independent study. Moreover, rs4646 is also the only variant that has an association with patient outcome that passes a multiple testing threshold and this variant is in linkage disequilibrium with rs727479, supporting the hypothesis that associations with patient outcome may be driven through the effects on circulating estradiol. Despite this preliminary evidence, well phenotyped and comprehensively genotyped patient sets need to be studied before conclusions can be drawn about the effects of CYP19A1 variation on AI efficacy.

In this study, we explored the effects of miR-15a-5p overexpression on apoptosis and invasion in lung cancer cells. The mRNA level of miR-15a-5p in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lines was determined by real-time PCR. The miR-15a-5p mimic was transiently transfected into lung cancer cells using Lipofectamine (TM) 2000 reagent. Subsequently, the Brdu-ELISA results showed that introduction of miR-15a-5p inhibited cell proliferation. In addition, miR-15a-5p overexpression could also inhibit EMT of A549 and H460 cells. qRT-PCR were used to determined the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 (MMP-2 and -9) in lung cancer cells. Next, we found that NF-kappa B1 expression was evidently reduced by up-regulation of miR-15a-5p. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that the NF-kappa B1 was a potential target gene of miR-15a-5p. Luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that miR-15a-5p could directly target the 3' UTR of NF-kappa B1.

"Acute bioprosthetic valve thrombosis can occur after surgery and sometimes cause hemodynamic instability and cardiogenic shock. Risk factors for bioprosthetic valve thrombosis are hypercoagulability, atrial fibrillation, atrial dilatation, low cardiac function, and lack of anticoagulation therapy. The authors present a case of severe mitral stenosis due to bioprosthetic valve thrombus. The patient was diagnosed with dilated-phase hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and underwent mitral valve replacement. He required venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) due to extremely low cardiac output and was scheduled for left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. Transesophageal echocardiographic examination before LVAD implantation revealed severe mitral stenosis due to bioprosthetic mitral valve thrombus, which was not detected by transthoracic echocardiography in the intensive care unit and contributed to the low cardiac function. The thrombus was removed through an unscheduled left atriotomy before LVAD implantation. The possibility of bioprosthetic valve thrombosis must be considered when the patient is dependent on VA-ECMO support. Early transesophageal echocardiographic examination of the bioprosthetic valve may be helpful and contribute to surgical decision-making.

"An analytical model to study the free vibration suppression of laminated curved beam with embedded actuating layers is presented in this study. The magnetostrictive layers are used to control and enhance the vibration suppression. The governing differential equations of the model are derived using the Hamilton principle. Analytical solution of the equations governing laminated curved beam with embedded magnetostrictive layers are obtained for simply-supported boundary conditions. Velocity feedback with constant gain distributed controller, by using Terfenol-D as smart material, is chosen to achieve vibration suppression. The effects of material properties, radius of curvature, lamination scheme, and placement of magnetostrictive layers with respect to laminate midplane on vibration suppression are studied in details.

"Airborne laser scanning (ALS) based stand level forest inventory has been used in Finland and other Nordic countries for several years. In the Russian Federation, ALS is not extensively used for forest inventory purposes, despite a long history of research into the use of lasers for forest measurement that dates back to the 1970s. Furthermore, there is also no generally accepted ALS-based methodology that meets the official inventory requirements of the Russian Federation. In this paper, a method developed for Finnish forest conditions is applied to ALS-based forest inventory in the Perm region of Russia. Sparse Bayesian regression is used with ALS data, SPOT satellite images and field reference data to estimate five forest parameters for three species groups (pine, spruce, deciduous): total mean volume, basal area, mean tree diameter, mean tree height, and number of stems per hectare. Parameter estimates are validated at both the plot level and stand level, and the validation results are compared to results published for three Finnish test areas. Overall, relative root mean square errors (RMSE) were higher for forest parameters in the Perm region than for the Finnish sites at both the plot and stand level. At the stand level, relative RMSE generally decreased with increasing stand size and was lower when considered overall than for individual species groups.

"According to self-determination theory, an individual's goal content and the processes involved in goal setting often represent the status of the individual's mental health and well-being. When examining the importance placed on goal setting, an individual's goals and aspirations are often synonymous with mental health and well-being. Aspiring to achieve intrinsic life goals has been associated with greater psychological well-being in literature. This study therefore aimed to establish the relationships between goals and aspirations, mental health behaviour (interpersonal relations, stress management, and spiritual growth), and psychological well-being (measured by positive affect). A sample of 457 secondary school learners in the Overberg Educational District, Western Cape, South Africa, participated in the study. The results suggest a significant positive relationship between placing importance on intrinsic goals and aspirations, and psychological well-being (as indicated by positive affect). However, psychological well-being was not correlated with mental health behaviour. The results of the hierarchical regression analysis suggest that importance placed on intrinsic goals and aspirations predicts psychological well-being and accounts for 8% of the variance. The results highlight the role of intrinsic goals and aspirations in predicting the psychological well-being of adolescents. The findings are supported by the theoretical assumptions of self-determination theory.

"A 5.35m high test embankment was constructed on a soft foundation improved by geotextile-encased granular columns (GECs). The embankment construction was performed in four stages over 65days, resulting in a total applied stress of around 150kPa. The soft soil and the encased columns were instrumented to measure surface settlements, excess pore pressure, surface vertical stresses, and radial deformation of the geotextile encasement. Stress concentration and the difference in settlement between the top of the encased columns and the soft soil were studied. Results showed that the differential settlement increased as the embankment height increased and when the excess pore pressure was being dissipated. Due to soil arching, the vertical stress supported by the encased column was over two times greater than the stress transmitted to the soft soil. Also, vertical stress on the encased column increased as consolidation progressed, whereas it did not vary significantly on the soft soil. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

"A methodology has been developed for selection of gear number and transmission gear ratios in mechanical part of a wheel-type tractor with electro-mechanical transmission containing a propulsion asynchronous electric motor with variable-frequency control. The paper proposes to determine a transmission gear ratio on the basis of the following: provision of wheel torque dependence on tractor speed which is the best one for a traction process and during transfer from one gear to the other; provision of nominal operational mode of the electric motor for all tractor operations where it is working for a long period of time; provision of minimum possible number of gears; complete realization of internal combustion engine power on the tractor wheels at limit operational mode of the electric motor. As a characteristic of the asynchronous electric motor with variable-frequency control contains various portions which can be used either completely or partially due to operating conditions, the gear number is determined in the process of transmission gear ration finding but not prior to this. A wheel torque of the tractor with electro-mechanical transmission can be limited according to the following factors: grip of wheel with supporting surface; maximum power of an internal combustion engine which can be transferred to the wheels and a torque which is developed by a propulsion electric motor. It is not proposed to exceed nominal operational mode of the propulsion electric motor for all the operations of the tractor if it is working for a long period of time because in the case of significant excess of the nominal operational mode of the asynchronous electric motor its rather long operation leads to low efficiency and high losses in power, large heat liberation and consequently requires to develop more complicated system for electric motor cooling. An excess of nominal electric motor torque can be justified for short-term operational modes because in this case there is no need to select more powerful electric motor and create an additional gear in the gear-box.

"Adsorption at the liquid-solid interface is widely used by the textile industry in processes such as dyeing, finishing, wastewater treatment, and many others. Precipitates of nano dimensions formed in situ have been used to form coherent, usually amorphous, films of metal oxides, sulfides, etc. on solid surfaces including textiles. This phenomena has been successfully used to polymerize pyrrole on the surface of textile fibers, fabrics, or yarns. While pyrrole is particularly suitable for this process, other monomers such as aniline or thiophene may be used, Polypyrrole is one of the more environmentally stable conductive materials and the above process has been successfully used in industrial production. The electrical properties and the environmental stability of the product depend on a number of variables such as concentration of the chemicals and particularly the dopants used. Furthermore, the environmental stability of the conductive textiles can be significantly improved by the use of certain additives in the polymerization. Numerous applications have been found for conductive textiles, especially in the field where their microwave adsorption characteristics are highly desirable. This is the case in military applications like camouflage and stealth technology.

"A nonlinear analysis framework for bluff-body aerodynamics based on Volterra theory is introduced to capture the linear and nonlinear aerodynamic effects. The Volterra kernels based on the impulse function concept are identified by way of the simulation of Navier-Stokes equations using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The computational schemes used here are validated through theoretical consideration, i.e., Blasius solution for the steady-state and Theodorsen solution for the system dynamic-state simulation. The source of nonlinearities in the aerodynamics of bluff bodies is systematically investigated. The simulation of bluff-body aerodynamics based on the Volterra reduced-order modeling scheme is obtained by the convolution of the identified kernels with the external inputs, e.g., turbulent inflow or body motion for aerodynamic or aeroelastic response, respectively. It is demonstrated that the Volterra theory-based nonlinear analysis framework for bluff-body aerodynamics combined with the identification of kernels using CFD promises to capture the salient features of bluff-body aerodynamics and offers an accurate reduced-order approximation of the Navier-Stokes equations with reduced level of computational effort.

"3D meshes are deployed in a wide range of application processes (e.g., transmission, compression, simplification, watermarking and so on) which inevitably introduce geometric distortions that may alter the visual quality of the rendered data. Hence, efficient model-based perceptual metrics, operating on the geometry of the meshes being compared, have been recently introduced to control and predict these visual artifacts. However, since the 3D models are ultimately visualized on 2D screens, it seems legitimate to use images of the models (i.e., snapshots from different viewpoints) to evaluate their visual fidelity. In this work we investigate the use of image metrics to assess the visual quality of 3D models. For this goal, we conduct a wide-ranging study involving several 2D metrics, rendering algorithms, lighting conditions and pooling algorithms, as well as several mean opinion score databases. The collected data allow (1) to determine the best set of parameters to use for this image-based quality assessment approach and (2) to compare this approach to the best performing model-based metrics and determine for which use-case they are respectively adapted. We conclude by exploring several applications that illustrate the benefits of image-based quality assessment.

"A brief overview of vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of bridge decks is presented, highlighting special VIV features concerning bridge decks. A popular VIV model (Van der Pol-type model) for bridge decks is examined in detail. Alternatively, a truncated Volterra series-based nonlinear oscillator is introduced to model the VIV system. Typical features of VIV such as the limit cycle oscillation (LCO), frequency shift, hysteresis, and beat phenomenon are parsimoniously and accurately captured in the proposed nonlinear model. As a functional expansion of a nonlinear system, the Volterra series is convenient for estimating the linear and nonlinear contributions to VIV. It is demonstrated that the relative contribution of nonlinear effects in VIV is around 50% of the total response for a range of bridge cross sections. The efficacy of the Volterra series as a reduced-order model (ROM) in capturing aerodynamic nonlinearities eliminates the need for reliance on conventional phenomenological models as it promises to offer a unified framework for nonlinear wind effects on long-span bridgesfor example, VIV, buffeting, and flutter.

(Background) In 2015, Gorji et al. proposed a novel method using pseudo Zernike moment. They tested four classifiers: learning vector quantization neural network, pattern recognition neural network trained by Levenberg-Marquardt, by resilient backpropagation, and by scaled conjugate gradient. Method: This study presents an improved method by introducing a relatively new classifier-linear regression classification. Our method selects one axial slice from 3D brain image, and employed pseudo Zernike moment with maximum order of 15 to extract 256 features from each image. Finally, linear regression classification was harnessed as the classifier. Results: The proposed approach obtains an accuracy of 97.51%, a sensitivity of 96.71%, and a specificity of 97.73%. Conclusion: Our method performs better than Gorji's approach and five other state-of-the-art approaches. Therefore, it can be used to detect Alzheimer's disease.

"A new method based on modified self-organizing maps is presented for the reconstruction of deep ocean current velocities from surface information provided by satellites. This method takes advantage of local correlations in the data-space to improve the accuracy of the reconstructed deep velocities. No assumptions regarding the structure of the water column, nor the underlying dynamics of the flow field, are made. Using satellite observations of surface velocity, sea-surface height and sea-surface temperature, as well as observations of the deep current velocity from autonomous Argo floats to train the map, we are able to reconstruct realistic high-resolution velocity fields at a depth of 1000 m. Validation reveals promising results, with a speed root mean squared error of similar to 2.8 cm.s(-1), more than a factor of two smaller than competing methods, and direction errors consistently smaller than 30 degrees.

"A novel dimensionality reduction method named nonlocal and local structure preserving projection (NLLSPP) is proposed and used for process monitoring. NLLSPP can simultaneously preserve the nonlocal structure (i.e., data variance) and the local structure (i.e., neighborhood relationships between data points) of the data set. According to nonadjacent or neighboring relationships of different pairs of data points, NLLSPP defines nonlocal or local similarity weight coefficients for pairwise data points on the basis of their distances. The nonlocal similarity weight coefficients force two nonadjacent data points to be projected far apart from each other. The local similarity weight coefficients force two neighboring data points to be projected near each other. In this way, nonlocal and local structures of the data set are naturally preserved and highlighted in a lower-dimensional space. Because of this advantage, NLLSPP is more powerful than principal component analysis (PCA) and locality preserving projections (LPP) in extracting important data characteristics. A process monitoring method is developed based on the NLLSPP algorithm. Its advantages are illustrated by a case study on the Tennessee Eastman process. The results indicate that the NLLSPP-based method has better monitoring performance that the PCA-based and LPP-based methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Although the problem of k-area coverage has been intensively investigated for dense wireless sensor networks (WSNs), how to arrive at a k-coverage sensor deployment that optimizes certain objectives in relatively sparse WSNs still faces both theoretical and practical difficulties. Moreover, only a handful of centralized algorithms have been proposed to elevate 2-D area coverage to 3-D surface coverage. In this paper, we present a practical algorithm, i.e., the Autonomous dePlOyment for Load baLancing k-surface cOverage (APOLLO), to move sensor nodes toward k-surface coverage, aiming at minimizing the maximum sensing range required by the nodes. APOLLO enables purely autonomous node deployment as it only entails localized computations. We prove the termination of the algorithm and the (local) optimality of the output. We also show that our optimization objective is closely related to other frequently considered objectives for 2-D area coverage. Therefore, our practical algorithm design also contributes to the theoretical understanding of the 2-D k-area coverage problem. Finally, we use extensive simulation results to both confirm our theoretical claims and demonstrate the efficacy of APOLLO.

"A host of mining practices produce fine-grained mineral sludge, such as mature fine tailing from oil-sand extraction. These sludges are hard to dewater because of their high clay content and their low hydraulic conductivity. This paper describes pressure filtration tests in which eight different nonwoven geotextiles (GTXs) were used to filter high-clay-content sludges. The sludges were formulated by mixing kaolinite and silt to obtain eight different grain-size distributions (GSDs) with d(50) ranging from 3 to 55 mu m and clay content ranging from 0% to 38% (d < 2 mu m). The sludges created for this research had the GSD and variability of real fine tailings. The results indicate that sludges can be filtered with nonwoven GTXs selected on the basis of their pore-opening size. Furthermore, calendered GTXs are more efficient in retaining particles than needle punched GTXs. In addition, only during the early stage of filtration do GTXs really influence filtering because it is at this stage that, by retaining coarser particles, they allow progressive formation of filter cake. Upon forming, the filter cake becomes the major contributor to particle retention. Finally, the sludge composition is found to be the most significant factor affecting the final state of dewatering.

"AIM To determine the functional role of miR-490-5p in mast cell proliferation and apoptosis, and in the mast cell tryptase/PAR-2 signal pathway. METHODS The 3rd generation of lentivirus vector systems containing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (Ruisai Inc., Shanghai, China), which acts as a reporter gene was used to construct the mmu-miR-490-5p lentivirus expression vector pEGFP-antagomiR-4905p, and the lentivirus vector pEGFP-negative was used as a negative control. The stably transfected mast cell line p815 was then constructed. GFP positive cells were successfully transfected cells. We determined the expression of miR-490-5p in p815 mast cells before and after transfection using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In addition, after transduction with the lentivirus vectors, the role of miR-490-5p in mast cell proliferation and apoptosis was investigated using the CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The mRNA levels of tryptase and PAR-2 were detected by qRT-PCR and the protein levels were detected by Western blot. RESULTS The inhibition of miR-490-5p expression promoted apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of p815 mast cells. The mRNA levels of tryptase and PAR-2 were significantly increased after transfection compared with the control group, tryptase (P = 0.721, normal vs null; P = 0.001, siRNA vs normal; P = 0.002, siRNA vs null) and PAR-2 (P = 0.027, siRNA vs null; P = 0.353, normal vs null; P = 0.105, siRNA vs normal). The protein levels of tryptase and PAR2 were slightly higher in the siRNA group than those in the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant (P >0.05). CONCLUSION miR-490-5p plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome by affecting mast cell proliferation and apoptosis; with down-regulation of miR-490-5p, the mRNA level of mast cell tryptase and PAR-2 increased, and the protein level increased, but the difference was not statistically significant.

"A modeling approach for battery as an Electrical Energy Storage System is proposed in this paper. The model aims to predict non-linear power delivery dynamics, given charge and discharge demand as a controllable input, not only in normal operating range of batteries, but also in extreme cases such as battery over-charging. In order to achieve that, the model is composed of separated voltage and current models. Several non-linear models, including Hammerstein model, non-linear open-circuit voltage characteristics, and Takacs hysteresis model are combined in the voltage and the current model, respectively. The state of charge of the battery can also be estimated in a recursive optimization fashion by the model. The parameterization and estimation methods of the model are described and also demonstrated on experimental data from a lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) cell. The experiment validation shows excellent agreement between measured and simulated voltage and current signals provided by the model during both normal operating and over-charging conditions. The contribution of this paper is given by the unique combination of data-based models used to capture linear dynamics, static non-linearity, and non-linear hysteresis effects in a single dynamic voltage/current model to simulate and predict the non-linear dynamic behavior of a battery as an energy storage/delivery system.

In contrast to the majority of previously reported research, this study also focuses on the characteristic non-circular femoral neck cross-sectional geometry and variation in bone mineral density (BMD) around the femoral neck. Twenty-two osteoarthritic and 7 osteoporotic femoral neck slices, collected from elective and trauma-related arthroplasty, and 16 cadaveric donor tissue controls were tested mechanically using Reference Point Indentation (BioDent (TM), Active Life Technologies, Santa Barbara, CA) and then scanned with in vitro-based radiography intended to replicate the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry technique. All parameters were measured regionally around the circumference of the femoral neck, allowing examination of spatial variability within the cortical bone. Fractured tissue was less resistant to indentation in the thinner superolateral segment compared to other segments and other groups. BMD around the fractured femoral necks appeared more consistent than that of nonfractured tissue, where BMD was reduced in the superolateral segment for the other groups. Cortical bone was thin in the superolateral segment for all groups except for the osteoarthritic group, and was thicker in the inferomedial segment for both osteoarthritic and fractured groups, resulting in the largest variation in buckling ratio (ratio of cortical bone diameter to cortical bone thickness) around the femoral neck for the fractured group. With age, healthy controls appeared to have lower inferomedial cortical thickness, whereas no significant differences in Reference Point Indentation measurements and density were observed. The study has highlighted several (both quality- and quantity-related) parameters that may be used to improve prediction of fracture risk.

The purpose of this cross-sectional observer study was to investigate (1) the inter- and intraobserver agreement of evaluating pisotriquetral OA using pisotriquetral views with a special focus on sclerosis, joint space width (JSW) narrowing and osteophyte formation, and (2) the incidence of these latter radiographic features in patients suspected for pisotriquetral OA. Five independent observers rated independently at two different occasions 27 pisotriquetral views from patients treated for ulnar-sided wrist pain suspected for pisotriquetral OA requiring a pisiform resection. The agreement was calculated using kappa statistic. Agreement between observers ranged from 0.38 (fair) to 0.56 (moderate). Average intraobserver agreement ranged from 0.43 (moderate) to 0.52 (moderate). In 36% of the ratings, JSW narrowing was observed, followed by osteophyte formation (30%) and sclerosis (28%). Observers found it especially difficult to detect JSW narrowing. Despite the availability of a pisotriquetral view to enhance visualization of the pisotriquetral joint, assessment of the specific features indicating pisotriquetral OA leads to only fair-to-moderate agreement. This limits the applicability of a radiographic assessment. A rationale for a more reliable radiologic approach in assessing the level of pisotriquetral OA is needed, which may require the use of more advanced imaging techniques.

Moreover, it may have parametric uncertainties, disturbances and un-modeled side reactions which may cause the reactor temperature to deviate from the reference value. This deviation may degrade quality of the product because the chemical reaction inside the CSTR depends on reactor temperature. For such a nonlinear, unstable and uncertain process, designing a control scheme with the ability to reject the effects of disturbances along with a good reference tracking capability is a challenging control engineering problem. In this work, a novel robust sliding mode control technique named as Improved Integral Sliding Mode Control (IISMC) has been presented for uncertain non-isothermal jacketed CSTR process. Moreover, a variety of recently developed sliding mode control techniques such as Classical Integral Sliding Mode Control (CISMC) and Super Twisted Algorithm based Sliding Mode Control (STA-SMC) have also been devised and compared with the proposed approach in order to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. A Lyapunov based analysis has also been provided to assure the robust stability of the closed loop process. Furthermore, in order to extend the state feedback approach to the output feedback scheme, two robust observers; High Gain Observer (HGO) and Extended High Gain Observer (EHGO), are also designed for the very process. They have also been compared with each other and have been investigated for robust stability using Lyapunov based approach. Finally, an output feedback control scheme using IISMC and EHGO has been presented and its performance has been examined and compared with the IISMC based state feedback approach. The simulation results show that the proposed control scheme effectively rejects the uncertainties and disturbances without leading the process to instability and offers good reference tracking capabilities.

"A 60frames/s CMOS image sensor with column-parallel inverter-based sigma-delta (Sigma Delta) ADCs is proposed in this paper. In order to improve the robustness of the inverter, instead of constant power supply, two buffers are designed to provide power supply for inverters. Instead of using of an operational amplifier, an inverter-based switch-capacitor (SC) circuit is adopted to low-voltage low-power Sigma Delta modulator. Detailed analysis and design optimization are provided. Due to the use of the inverter-based Sigma Delta ADCs, the conversion speed is improved while reducing the area and power consumption. The proposed CMOS image sensor has been fabricated with 0.18 mu m CMOS process. The measurement results show that the random noise (RN) is 7e(rms)(-), the pixel conversion gain is 100 mu V/e(-). Since the measured full well capacity of the pixel is 25000e(-), the CMOS image sensor achieves a 71 dB dynamic range (DR). The total power consumption at 60frame/s is 58.2 mW. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Addictions, including alcohol use disorders, are characterized by the loss of control over drug seeking and consumption, but the neural circuits and signaling mechanisms responsible for the transition from controlled use to uncontrolled abuse remain incompletely understood. Prior studies have shown that compulsive-like' behaviors in rodents, for example, persistent responding for ethanol (EtOH) despite punishment, are increased after chronic exposure to EtOH. The main goal of the current study was to assess the effects of chronic intermittent EtOH (CIE) exposure on multiple, putative measures of compulsive-like EtOH seeking in C57BL/6J mice. Mice were exposed to two or four weekly cycles of CIE and then, post-withdrawal, tested for progressive ratio responding for EtOH, sustained responding during signaled EtOH unavailability and (footshock) punished suppression of responding for EtOH. Results showed that mice exposed to CIE exhibited attenuated suppression of EtOH seeking during punishment, as compared with air-exposed controls. By contrast, CIE exposure affected neither punished food reward-seeking behavior, nor other putative measures of compulsive-like EtOH seeking. Ex vivo reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of brain tissue found reduced sensitivity to punished EtOH seeking after CIE exposure was accompanied by a significant increase in gene expression of the GluN1 and GluN2A subunits of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, specifically in the medial orbitofrontal cortex. Moreover, slice electrophysiological analysis revealed increased N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-mediated currents in the orbitofrontal cortex after CIE exposure in test-naive mice. Collectively, the current findings add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating that chronic exposure to EtOH fosters resistance to punished EtOH seeking in association with adaptations in cortical glutamatergic transmission.

"A disrupted oppositional based gravitational search algorithm (DOGSA) tuned sliding mode controller (SMC) is proposed in this study for the solution of automatic generation control of interconnected multi-area power system under deregulated environment. The novelty of the control scheme is established by performing the sensitivity analysis under different conditions such as variation of the system load, turbine time constant, governor time constant and tie-line power coefficient. The dynamic response of the system under consideration is also studied and analysed in the presence of non-linear constraints namely generation rate constraint with reheat steam turbine, governor deadband and time delay during signal processing. Further, in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed DOGSA tuning over the genetic algorithm and differential evolution tuned schemes reported in the literature, it is also employed to tune the integral (I), proportional-integral (PI), integral-derivative (ID) and proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers. Moreover, the performance of the optimised SMC scheme is also compared with I, PI, ID and PID controllers. The comparative results reveal that SMC scheme tuned using DOGSA gives better results than the conventional controllers.

"Age-related changes in testosterone are believed to be a key component of the processes that contribute to cognitive aging in men. The APOE-epsilon 4 allele may interact with testosterone and moderate the hormone's association with cognition. The goals of the present study were to examine the degree to which free testosterone is associated with episodic memory in a community-based sample of middle-aged men, and examine the potential interaction between free testosterone and the APOE-epsilon 4 allele. Data were used from 717 participants in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging. Average age was 55.4 years (standard deviation = 2.5). Significant positive associations were observed between free testosterone level and verbal episodic memory, as well as a significant interaction between free testosterone and APOE-epsilon 4 status. In epsilon 4 carriers free testosterone was positively associated with verbal episodic memory performance (story recall), whereas no association was observed in epsilon 4 noncarriers. Results support the hypothesis that APOE-epsilon 4 status increases susceptibility to other risk factors, such as low testosterone, which may ultimately contribute to cognitive decline or dementia.

"A complete model of a thermionic generator has been developed in order to optimise the technology for application in the solar thermal generation of electricity. Steady state current densities predicted by the model have been shown to agree with published experimental thermionic data. Two separate genetic algorithm optimisations have been carried out for both power density and efficiency, in which electrode temperatures and work functions, external circuit resistance and electrode separation were varied. The result of these optimisations were two configurations separately exhibiting a maximum power density of 1.66 W/cm(2), and a Maximum efficiency of 7.69% for parameter ranges applicable to concentrating solar thermal power. Examination of the optimum simulation parameters indicated that future developments in lowering collector work functions, increasing emitter service temperature and decreasing attainable electrode separations will all positively impact device performance.

"Analytical treatment of a linear elastic isotropic bi-material full-space reinforced by an interfacial thin film under axisymmetric normal loading is addressed. The thin film is modeled as an extensible membrane perfectly bonded to the half-spaces. By virtue of Love's potential function and Hankel integral transform, elastic fields of the system are explicitly written in the form of semi-infinite line integrals. The analytical results are verified by the special cases corresponding to the surface stiffened half-space and classical bi-material problem. The limiting cases of reinforced homogeneous full-space and inextensible membrane are presented and discussed. The proposed formulation is also applicable for studying reinforced auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratio. The surface/interface effect on the elastic responses of two perfectly bonded half-spaces is also simulated by assigning equivalent surface elastic constant to the membrane stiffness. Effects of thin film stiffness, material properties, loading depth, and surface/interface effect are studied by some numerical examples. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"A significant challenge faced by the mobile application industry is developing and maintaining multiple native variants of mobile applications to support different mobile operating systems, devices and varying application functional requirements. The current industrial practice is to develop and maintain these variants separately. Any potential change has to be applied across variants manually, which is neither efficient nor scalable. We consider the problem of supporting multiple platforms as a 'software product-line engineering' problem. The paper proposes a novel application of product-line model-driven engineering to mobile application development and addresses the key challenges of feature-based native mobile application variants for multiple platforms. Specifically, we deal with three types of variations in mobile applications: variation due to operation systems and their versions, software and hardware capabilities of mobile devices, and functionalities offered by the mobile application. We develop a tool MOPPET that automates the proposed approach. Finally, the results of applying the approach on two industrial case studies show that the proposed approach is applicable to industrial mobile applications and have potential to significantly reduce the development effort and time.

Detecting fundamental anomalous patterns is necessary for a solution to be able to detect as many types of attacks and malicious activities as possible. Our evidence gathering framework correlates multiple patterns detected, thereby increasing the confidence of detection, and resulting in increase in accuracy and decrease in false positives.

"A method is developed for reducing the power inverter electrical circuit of fourth order to an electrical network of second order. The reduction is based on the assumption that the output inverter voltage is practically with a sine-wave shape. The normalized form guarantees novelty and versatility of the investigation on one hand and independency in relation to the concrete inverter parameters like output power, supplying voltage and operating frequency on the other. From the whole power network of fourth order for the first time two sub circuits are suggested to be outlined: the output (load) sub circuit and the inverter commutating sub circuit. Both sub circuits of a second order define the parameters of the endmost inverter circuit again of the same order and consequently the mode of operation and parameters of the power inverter itself. The transformation is possible owing to the newly found fact that the frequency dependencies of the output (load) sub circuit can be separated from the dependencies that describe the structural relationships between the two sub circuits. The results from that conversion are of course more accurate when the resonant frequencies of the both sub circuits and the operating frequency do not differ substantially. The suggested approach is useful on order to obtain a simplified engineer method for precise and fast design of large class of static power converters applicable in electronic technology like induction heating and melting.

"A shared approach to decision-making framework has been suggested for chronic disease management especially where multiple treatment options exist. Shared decision-making (SDM) requires that both physician and patients are actively engaged in the decision-making process, including information exchange; expressing treatment preferences; as well as agreement over the final treatment decision. Although SDM appears well supported by patients, practitioners and policymakers alike, the current challenge is to determine how best to make SDM a reality in everyday clinical practice. Within the context of asthma, adherence rates are poor and are linked to outcomes such as reduced asthma control, increased symptoms, healthcare expenditures, and lower patient quality of life. It has been suggested that SDM can improve treatment adherence and that ignoring patients' personal goals and preferences may result in reduced rates of adherence. Furthermore, understanding predictors of poor treatment adherence is a necessary step toward developing effective strategies to improve the patient-reported and clinically important outcomes. Here, we describe why a shared approach to treatment decision-making for asthma has the potential to be an effective tool for improving adherence, with associated clinical and patient-related outcomes. In addition, we explore insights into the reasons why SDM has not been implemented into routine clinical practice.

"A novel topology suitable for emulating fractional-order capacitors and inductors using current excitation is achieved using a fractional-order differentiator/integrator block and appropriately configured Operational Transconductance Amplifiers.

This implementation allows for electronic tuning of the order, capacitance/inductance, and bandwidth of operation by modification of only the bias current.

Surprisingly, it was found that an increase of injury incidences occurred during practice. Fifty-eight injuries required medical assistance. The majority of injuries (80%) were located in the lower extremities. Collision with other players was the most common activity at the time of injury, accounting for 40% of all injuries.

"A novel normalized least mean square (NLMS)-based algorithm is proposed to locate the active taps of the unknown impulse response in the application of network echo cancellation. Starting with the full length of the unknown echo path, the start-tap and end-tap estimates of the active region adapt, respectively, in the form of fractional tap. The effective tap-length estimate is defined by the length between the start-tap and end-tap estimates. The filter tap-weight vector is then updated with this effective tap-length estimate following the NLMS algorithm, while the tap weights located beyond the effective tap-length estimate are directly set to zero. In case that the active region of the unknown echo path shifts in a large scale, the start-tap and end-tap estimates are reset to the full length when the effective tap-length estimate is lower than a predetermined threshold value. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed fractional tap-based algorithm can efficiently locate and track the effective tap length of the unknown echo path when the active coefficients change abruptly in locations and magnitudes, outperforming the existing stochastic tap-based schemes.

Even if there is a lack of data, e-cigarettes offer much lower risks than tobacco. (2) A dual user is at high risk of returning to exclusive tobacco use; he should also optimize other nicotine intakes by combining nicotine replacement therapy and/or optimizing the nicotine intake through the e-cigarette.

"Although phosphorus (P) is an essential element needed for all lives, excess P can be harmful to the environment. The objective of this study aims to determine P flows in the fisheries sector of Thailand consisting of both sea and freshwater activities of captures and cultures. Currently, the annual fisheries catch averages 3.44 +/- 0.50 Mt. Most comes from marine capture 1.95 +/- 0.46 Mt, followed by coastal aquaculture 0.78 +/- 0.09 Mt, freshwater aquaculture 0.49 +/- 0.05 Mt, and inland capture 0.22 +/- 0.01 Mt. Of this total, about 11% is contained in fresh products directly sold in local markets for consumption, while 89% is sent to processing factories prior to being sold in local markets and exported. The quantities of P entering the fisheries sector come from captures, import of fisheries products and feed produced from agriculture. This P input to the fisheries sector is found to average 28,506 t P.y(-1) based on the past ten-year records. Of this total, P input from captures accounts for 76%; while, 11% represents aquatic feeds from agriculture and animal manures. About 13% is obtained from the imports of fishery products. Coastal and freshwater aquacultures are found to be P consumers because their feeds are almost all produced from agricultural crops grown inland. Moreover, these activities cause most of P losses, approximately 10,188 t P.y(-1), which account for 89% of the total P loss from the fisheries sector. Overall, P in the fisheries sector is found to mobilize through three channels: (a) 44% is consumed within the country; (b) about 16% is exported; and, (c) 40% is lost from the ecosystem. Based on the results of this work it is recommended that future research be directed on ways to minimize P loss and maximize P recycle in Thailand's fisheries sector as to enhance its food security and curtail water pollution.

The stochastic nature of precipitation dominates water balance of rainwater harvesting systems, and the theory of stochastic control better serves for determining optimal strategies for water management.

Stochastic control problems are formulated and then solved to obtain the optimal irrigation strategies during dry spells.

"A fundamental process in construction cost estimation is the appropriate adjustment of costs to reflect project location. Unfortunately, location adjustment factors are not available for all locations. To overcome this lack of data, cost estimators in the United States often use adjustment factors from adjacent locations, referred to as the nearest neighbor (NN) method. However, these adjacent locations may not have similar economic conditions, which limit the accuracy of the NN method. This research proposes a new method of using nighttime light satellite imagery (NLSI) to estimate location adjustment factors where they do not exist. The NLSI method for estimating location adjustment factors was evaluated against an established cost index database, and results show that NLSI can be used to effectively estimate location adjustment factors. When compared with NN and other alternative proximity-based location adjustment methods, the proposed NLSI method leads to a 25-40% reduction of the median absolute error. This work contributes to the body of knowledge by introducing a more accurate method for estimating location adjustment factors which can improve cost estimates for construction projects where location adjustment factors do not currently exist.

"A microstructure-based modeling method is developed to predict the mechanical behaviors of lithium ion battery separators. Existing battery separator modeling methods cannot capture the structural features on the microscale. To overcome this issue, we propose an image-based microstructure Representative Volume Element (RVE) modeling method, which facilitates the understanding of the separators complex macro mechanical behaviors from the perspective of microstructural features. A generic image processing workflow is developed to identify different phases in the microscopic image. The processed RVE image supplies microstructural information to the Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Both mechanical behavior and microstructure evolution are obtained from the simulation. The evolution of microstructure features is quantified using the stochastic microstructure characterization methods. The proposed method successfully captures the anisotropic behavior of the separator under tensile test, and provides insights into the microstructure deformation, such as the growth of voids. We apply the proposed method to a commercially available separator as the demonstration. The analysis results are validated using experimental testing results that are reported in literature.

"A darknet monitoring system is developed to grasp malicious activities on the Internet in an early stage and to cope with them. The darknet monitoring system consists of network sensors deployed widely on the Internet. The sensors capture incoming unsolicited packets. A goal of this system analyzes captured malicious packets and provides effective information for protecting good Internet users from malicious activities. To provide effective and reliable information, sensors must be deployed in secret and hidden from outside. On the other hand, attackers intend to detect sensors for evading them. This attempt is known as localization attacks to darknet monitoring systems. If actual location of sensors is revealed to attackers, it is almost impossible to grasp the latest tactics used by attackers. Thus in our previous work, we proposed a packet sampling method, which samples incoming packets based on an attribute of packets sender, to increase a tolerance to a localization attack and to keep a high quality of information publicized by the system. As a result, we almost succeeded to counter from a localization attack, which generates spike on the publicized graph to detect a sensor. However in some cases, proposed sampling method works to attacker's advantage and spikes appear clearly on the graph. Therefore, we propose advanced sampling methods, which sample incoming packets based on multiple attributes of packets sender. In this paper, we present our improved methods and show a promising evaluation result obtained from the simulation.

"Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) is a mature hydrogen production technology and there exists a range of economic assessments for available technologies. For advanced AWEs, which may be based on novel polymer-based membrane concepts, it is of prime importance that development comes along with new configurations and technical and economic key process parameters for AWE that might be of interest for further economic assessments. This paper presents an advanced AWE technology referring to three different sites in Europe (Germany, Austria, and Spain). The focus is on financial metrics, the projection of key performance parameters of advanced AWEs, and further financial and tax parameters. For financial analysis from an investor's (business) perspective, a comprehensive assessment of a technology not only comprises cost analysis but also further financial analysis quantifying attractiveness and supply/market flexibility. Therefore, based on cash flow (CF) analysis, a comprehensible set of metrics may comprise levelised cost of energy or, respectively, levelized cost of hydrogen (LCH) for cost assessment, net present value (NPV) for attractiveness analysis, and variable cost (VC) for analysis of market flexibility. The German AWE site turns out to perform best in all three financial metrics (LCH, NPV, and VC). Though there are slight differences in investment cost and operation and maintenance cost projections for the three sites, the major cost impact is due to the electricity cost. Although investment cost is slightly lower and labor cost is significantly lower in Spain, the difference can not outweigh the higher electricity cost compared to Germany. Given the assumption that the electrolysis operators are customers directly and actively participating in power markets, and based on the regulatory framework in the three countries, in this special case electricity cost in Germany is lowest. However, as electricity cost is profoundly influenced by political decisions as well as the implementation of economic instruments for transforming electricity systems toward sustainability, it is hardly possible to further improve electricity price forecasts.

The values of skewness and kurtosis coefficients are used to define the frequency distribution type of the above radiation parameters on a monthly basis. The statistical analysis is extended to the daily clearness index (K-T), diffuse ratio (K-D), and the ratio of horizontal beam to global radiation (K-B,K-G). Furthermore, the influencing factors on the magnitude of the radiation components were examined. The value of K-T was used to classify three different types of days such as clear, partially cloudy and cloudy days. Then, a statistical analysis of the solar radiation components was performed. On an average annual basis, more than 80% of the days are classified as either clear or partially cloudy at both stations. Additionally, the influence of the atmospheric absorption and scattering of the solar radiation under clear skies was examined on the basis of the Linke turbidity factor (T-L). The results of this analysis are used to characterize and compare the radiation regimes of the two sites. Both sites have relatively high intensity of global and direct horizontal radiation. The annual average daily global radiation intensity is 18.5 MJ m(-2) at Athalassa and 19.9 MJ m(-2) at Larnaca. The horizontal beam radiation is 13.1 MJ m(-2) for Athalassa and 14.2 MJ m(-2) for Larnaca. Therefore, the fraction of the beam component of the global radiation is comparatively high at both sites, as indicated by the annual average daily fraction which is greater than 0.600. Generally, Larnaca has slightly higher rates of global radiation than Athalassa, as indicated by the average yearly cumulative global irradiation which is 6763 MJ m(-2) for Athalassa and 7274 MJ m(-2) for Larnaca.

"Activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPAR delta) induces the expression of genes encoding enzymes that metabolize fatty acids and carbohydrate. Attempts to identify cellular activators of PPAR delta produced large lists of various fatty acids and their metabolic derivatives; however, there is no consensus on specific and selective binding interactions of natural ligands with PPAR delta. Most models on binding interactions within the ligand binding domain (LBD) of PPAR delta have been derived from analyses of PPAR delta-LBD crystals formed with synthetic low molecular weight ligands. Nonetheless, crystals of the whole receptor with natural ligands or of its heterodimer with its cognate retinoid X receptor (RXR) are not yet available for analysis. We have found that 4-hydroxyalkenals, non-enzymatic peroxidation products of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), namely, 4-hydroxy-2E,6Z-dodecadienal (4-HDDE) and 4-hydroxy-2E-nonenal (4-HNE), activate PPAR delta in vascular endothelial cells and insulin-secreting beta cells, respectively. In both cases activated PPAR delta induced adaptive responses that allowed the cells to adjust to ambient stressful metabolic conditions. This review article addresses the interactions of 4-hydroxyalkenals with PPAR delta and the resulting hormetic interactions in cells exposed to nutrient overload conditions.

"A theory-based intervention strategy to improve purchasing decision-maker perceptions of ventilated tools was developed, implemented, and tested. The intervention was designed to target key constructs of the prevention through design adoption readiness model (PtD ARM), a previously published conceptual model. A Web-based intervention was developed that included information about the health effects of construction dust, a testimonial by a firm owner, and a video demonstrating side-by-side use of both ventilated and nonventilated tools, which provided visual evidence of dust generation and productivity performance. In a pretest/posttest with a control group and an experimental design, purchasing decision makers (n=49) were contacted by telephone. A validated survey instrument was used to collect perception data and open-ended responses regarding barrier information. Gain score t-test analysis found significant improvements in perceived ease of use, health knowledge, and perceived risk in the intervention group. Open-ended results identified barriers to the use of ventilated tools. The intervention methods presented in this paper can be used by future researchers and occupational safety and health practitioners to improve the use of safety innovations.

"A rectangular phase screen transmission model is usually applied to the simulation of optical propagation processes in atmospheric turbulence. In this paper, we analyze the relationship between fractal Brownian motion and atmospheric turbulence firstly. Then based on the classical fractal algorithm, a new algorithm is proposed to generate a rectangular phase screen, which combines the random midpoint displacement (RMD) principle with the successive random additions (SRA) technique. It mainly contains three interpolation methods including square interpolation, trigonometric interpolation and diamond interpolation, respectively. Therefore we call the algorithm (S-T-D)RMD-SRA. We carry out the split-step method to propagate beam through atmospheric turbulence, which is simulated by a rectangular phase screens transmission model. Numerical simulations show that the new algorithm and traditional FFT-based algorithm on the statistical properties are almost consistent with the theoretical value. Furthermore, it has high performance in computation time and parallel efficiency.

From a given and close set of audio events, commonly found in broadcast news transmissions, a large set of audio descriptors is extracted and their data-driven ranking of relevance is clustered, providing a more robust feature selection. The clusters of the feature space are feeding machine learning algorithms implemented as classification models during the experimental evaluation. This methodology showed that support vector machines provide significantly good results, considering the achieved accuracy due to their ability of coping well in high dimensionality experimental conditions.

"Adolescence is a potentially important time in the development of emotion regulation and parenting behaviors may play a role. We examined associations among parenting behaviors, parent resting heart rate variability, adolescent resting heart rate variability and parenting behaviors as moderators of the association between parent and adolescent resting heart rate variability. Ninety-seven youth (11-17 years; 49.5 % female; 34 % African American, 37.1 % Euro-American, 22.6 % other/mixed ethnic background, and 7.2 % Hispanic) and their parents (n = 81) completed a physiological assessment and questionnaires assessing parenting behaviors. Inconsistent discipline and corporal punishment were negatively associated with adolescent resting heart rate variability, while positive parenting and parental involvement were positively associated. Inconsistent discipline and parental involvement moderated the relationship between parent and adolescent resting heart rate variability. The findings provide evidence for a role of parenting behaviors in shaping the development of adolescent resting heart rate variability with inconsistent discipline and parental involvement potentially influencing the entrainment of resting heart rate variability in parents and their children.

"A new technique to measure a capacitor or a capacitive sensor by means of a direct sensor-to-microcontroller interface circuit that does not need a calibration capacitor is proposed. Basically, the measurement process consists of three consecutive steps of charge, discharge and charge of the capacitor under test. A non-linear equation is obtained and solved that is dependent only on known circuit parameters. Experimental results show that it is possible to measure a wide range of capacitor values with a maximum deviation of 2% from the reference value, and that temperature changes from 18 to 70 degrees C yield relative errors below 0.1%. For the lowest measured capacitor range (33 pF-4.7 nF) the uncertainty holds below 1 pF which enables measurement of commercially available capacitive sensors. The main advantage of the proposed technique is cost and space reduction of the final design.

"An aluminum foam can be characterized by its architecture and by the solid phase' microstructure. Our aim is to link the foam's morphological and microstructural features with its mechanical properties thanks to X-ray tomography and finite element (FE). An approach combining X-ray tomography at different resolutions, image processing, and FE modeling was developed to take into account the influence of the intermetallics on the foam's fracture. First, the samples were scanned with ""local"" tomography, where the specimen is placed close to the X-ray source. These images allowed for observing intermetallics. Then an in situ tensile test was performed in the tomograph to follow the sample's deformation at low resolution. The images obtained from local tomography were processed to create one low-resolution image of the initial sample including details from high resolution. This was done by a series of thresholding and scaling of the high-resolution images. This image was used to generate a FE mesh. A FE input file was obtained thanks to Java programs associating the elements to the phases. At the local scale, the calculated stress distribution and the images of the struts were analysed. Our work confirms that the presence of inclusions can explain the fracture of struts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,

"A measurement-based method to evaluate the efficiency of antennas used in microwave tissue imaging is proposed. The method is versatile and, in principle, applicable to antennas operating in free space as well. Two identical antennas are employed, one transmitting and the other one receiving. A signal flow graph (SFG) is developed for the two-port network formed by the antennas and the medium between them. The medium's electrical properties mimic those of tissue and can vary according to the application. Several measurements are performed with one of the antennas being loaded with known loads. A system of equations is constructed from the acquired data. The solution of this system produces the efficiency of the antenna in addition to other unknown parameters of the SFG. The efficiencies of two antennas are estimated from measured and simulated data and are verified through comparisons.

"Adenosine triphosphate is involved in many metabolic reactions, but it has also a role as a cellular danger signal transmitted through purinergic receptors (PRs). Indeed, adenosine 5;-triphosphate (ATP) can bind to PRs which are found in the membrane of many cell types, although the relative proportions of the receptor subtypes differ. PRs are classified according to genetic and pharmacological criteria and especially their affinities for agonists and their transduction mechanism (i.e. as metabotropic P2YRs or ionotropic P2XRs). Extracellular ATP release by activated or necrotic cells may activate various PRs and especially P2X7R, the best-characterized PR, on immune cells. P2X7R is known to regulate the activation of the Nod-like receptor (NLR)-family protein, NLRP3 inflammasome, which permit the release of IL-1b, a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine. The P2X7R/NLRP3 pathway is involved in many inflammatory diseases, such as gout, and in fibrosis diseases associated with inflammatory process, liver or lung fibrosis. Some authors imaging also a real promising therapeutic potential of P2X7R blockage. Thus, several pharmaceutical companies have developed P2X7R antagonists as novel anti-inflammatory drug candidates. Clinical trials of the efficacy of these antagonists are now underway. A better understanding of the P2X7R/NLRP3 signalling pathways permits the identification of targets and the development of a new class of drugs able to inhibit the fibrogenesis process and collagen deposition.

"A significant challenge in electric vehicles with multiple motors is how to control the individual drivetrains in order to achieve measurable benefits in terms of vehicle cornering response, compared to conventional stability control systems actuating the friction brakes. This paper presents a direct yaw moment controller based on the combination of feedforward and feedback contributions for continuous yaw rate control. When the estimated sideslip exceeds a pre-defined threshold, a sideslip-based yaw moment contribution is activated. All yaw moment contributions are entirely tunable through model-based approaches, for reduced vehicle testing time. The purpose of the controller is to continuously modify the vehicle understeer characteristic in quasi-static conditions and increase yaw and sideslip damping during transients. Skid-pad, step-steer and sweep steer tests are carried out with a front-wheel-drive fully electric vehicle demonstrator with two independent drivetrains. The experimental test results of the electric motor-based actuation of the direct yaw moment controller are compared with those deriving from the friction brake-based actuation of the same algorithm, which is a major contribution of this paper. The novel results show that continuous direct yaw moment control allows significant ""on-demand"" changes of the vehicle response in cornering conditions and to enhance active vehicle safety during extreme driving maneuvers.

"A review of 92 heap leach projects from 15 countries provides a starting point for a series of experiments, at 22 degrees C and a vertical pressure of 2000 kPa, to examine short-term puncturing and the development of geomembrane strains that could affect longer-term performance. Underliners of gravel with some sand or those of gravel and sand caused significant puncturing and excessive strains in the geomembrane for the conditions examined. The shape of the underliner grading curve had a much greater effect on the potential for puncturing and the magnitude of the strains in the geomembrane than just the maximum particle size. Of the six granular underliners examined, the best performance was for the well graded gravelly sand with some silt which offered sufficient support to minimize the strains in the geomembrane due to the overliner while not inducing significant strains directly from the underliner. Nevertheless even in this case the maximum strain of 11% is almost double the maximum recommended in the literature for ensuring good long-term performance of the geomembrane. Consideration of composite liners with GCLs and compacted clay liners shows that the more deformable the foundation, the larger are the indentations and strains induced in the geomembrane by a given overliner. For the specific conditions examined, it is shown that there was no apparent improvement in performance for an LLDPE geomembrane versus the HDPE geomembrane tested. A 540 g/m(2) geotextile protection layer above the geomembrane was also found to be insufficient to prevent significant strains in the geomembrane due to the overliner examined.

"Alert intelligent device is an ambient assisted living (AAL) system that allows the evaluation of potentially dangerous situations for elderly people living alone at home. This evaluation is obtained by an ad hoc network of sensor nodes, working in conjunction with an ambient intelligence layer embedded in a personal computer that learns from user behaviour patterns and warns when a detected pattern differs significantly from previously acquired normal patterns. Each new datum read from sensors is processed in the ambient intelligence layer through three processing levels: shallow, intermediate and deep. The shallow processing level focuses on physical data and sensory features. The intermediate level covers information interpretation and its translation into the form required by the third level: the reasoning processing or deep level. In alert intelligent device, energy is a critical issue, so that sensor devices need to be properly designed and managed to achieve significant energy saving. The use of bed/chair occupancy sensors is mandatory for this kind of ubiquitous computing system. A first way to approach this problem relied on the use of pressure mats, but several environmental drawbacks showed them inappropriate as an efficient and reliable solution for large volume deployments. Moreover, solutions based on force-to-resistor transducers entail power consumption budgets that keep them from being integrated on wireless sensor nodes. In this paper, a force-capacitive transducer based sensor has been proposed, implemented and tested. This sensor is based on electromechanical film (EMFi) transducers, which are able to detect force variations in a quasi-passive way. This kind of transducer behaves as capacitors with variable capacitance depending on the force exerted on its surface. We have developed a new technique to carry out the characterization of these transducers, where the detection of a force change is used to trigger an active mechanism that allows us to measure the weight by means of a novel modelling approach. A low-power wireless sensor node prototype that includes this new transducer has been assembled and tested on a wide range of weights. Occupancy detection achieved by this technology has proven to be successful, increasing the total power consumption of the node by less than 15%, which makes it suitable for implementation.

"A sample of 512 Chinese was studied and we observed that greater disc degeneration on MRI was associated with greater spine DXA BMD. Yet, this association may be confounded by facet joint osteoarthritis. BMD may not be a risk factor for lumbar disc degeneration in Chinese. Purpose Evidence suggested that lumbar vertebral bone and intervertebral disc interact with each other in multiple ways. The current paper aims to determine the association between bone mineral density (BMD) and lumbar disc degeneration using a sample of Chinese. Methods We studied 165 patients with back disorders and 347 general subjects from China. All subjects had lumbar spine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) spine BMD studies, and a subset of general subjects had additional hip BMD measurements. On T2-weighted MR images, Pfirrmann score was used to evaluate the degree of lumbar disc degeneration and facet joint osteoarthritis was assessed as none, slight-moderate, and severe. Regression analyses were used to examine the associations between lumbar and hip BMD and disc degeneration, adjusting for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), lumbar region, and facet joint osteoarthritis. Results Greater facet joint osteoarthritis was associated with greater spine BMD (P0.05), and between hip BMD and disc degeneration in general subjects (P >0.05). Conclusion BMD may not be a risk factor for lumbar disc degeneration in Chinese. Facet joint osteoarthritis inflates DXA spine BMD measurements and therefore, may confound the association between spine BMD and disc degeneration.

"A control-oriented, two-timescale, linear, dynamic, response model of the rotational transform iota profile and the normalized beta beta(N) is proposed based on experimental data from the DIII-D tokamak. Dedicated system-identification experiments without feedback control have been carried out to generate data for the development of this model. The data-driven dynamic model, which is both device-specific and scenario-specific, represents the response of the iota profile and beta(N) to the electric field due to induction as well as to the heating and current drive (H&CD) systems during the flat-top phase of an H-mode discharge in DIII-D. The control goal is to use both induction and the H&CD systems to locally regulate the plasma iota profile and beta(N) around particular target values close to the reference state used for system identification. A singular value decomposition (SVD) of the plasma model at steady state is carried out to decouple the system and identify the most relevant control channels. A mixed-sensitivity robust control design problem is formulated based on the dynamic model to synthesize a stabilizing feedback controller without input constraints that minimizes the reference tracking error and rejects external disturbances with minimal control energy. The feedback controller is then augmented with an anti-windup compensator, which keeps the given controller well-behaved in the presence of magnitude constraints in the actuators and leaves the nominal closed-loop system unmodified when no saturation is present. The proposed controller represents one of the first feedback profile controllers integrating magnetic and kinetic variables ever implemented and experimentally tested in DIII-D. The preliminary experimental results presented in this work, although limited in number and constrained by actuator problems and design limitations, as it will be reported, show good progress towards routine current profile control in DIII-D and leave valuable lessons for further advancements in the field.

"Among many factors that influence the success of a software project, the software process model employed is an essential one. An improper process model will be time consuming, error-prone and cost expensive, and further lower the quality of software. Therefore, how to choose an appropriate software process model is a very important problem for software development. Current works focus on the selection criteria and often lead to subjective results. In this paper, we propose a software process model recommendation method, to help project managers choose the most appropriate software process model for a new project at an early stage of development process according to historical software engineering data. The proposed method casts the process model recommendation into a classification problem. It first evaluates the different combinations of the alternative classification and attribute selection algorithms, and the best one is used to build the recommendation model with historical software engineering data; then, the constructed recommendation model is used to predict process models for a new software project with only a few data. We also analyze the mutual impacts between process models and different types of project factors, to further help managers locate the most suitable process model. We found process models are also responsible for defect count, defect severity and software change. Experiments on the data sets from 37 different development teams of different countries show that the average recommendation accuracy of our method reaches up to 82.5%, which makes it potentially useful in practice.

"Aging is associated with an increase in circulating inflammatory factors. One, the cytokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1 or CXCL12), is critical to stem cell mobilization, migration, and homing as well as to bone marrow stem cell (BMSC), osteoblast, and osteoclast function. SDF-1 has pleiotropic roles in bone formation and BMSC differentiation into osteoblasts/osteocytes, and in osteoprogenitor cell survival. The objective of this study was to examine the association of plasma SDF-1 in participants in the cardiovascular health study (CHS) with bone mineral density (BMD), body composition, and incident hip fractures. In 1536 CHS participants, SDF-1 plasma levels were significantly associated with increasing age (p < 0.01) and male gender (p = 0.04), but not with race (p = 0.63). In multivariable-adjusted models, higher SDF-1 levels were associated with lower total hip BMD (p = 0.02). However, there was no significant association of SDF-1 with hip fractures (p = 0.53). In summary, circulating plasma levels of SDF-1 are associated with increasing age and independently associated with lower total hip BMD in both men and women. These findings suggest that SDF-1 levels are linked to bone homeostasis.

"A smart community is a distributed system consisting of a set of smart homes which utilize the smart home scheduling techniques to enable customers to automatically schedule their energy loads targeting various purposes such as electricity bill reduction. Smart home scheduling is usually implemented in a decentralized fashion inside a smart community, where customers compete for the community level renewable energy due to their relatively low prices. Typically there exists an aggregator as a community wide electricity policy maker aiming to minimize the total electricity bill among all customers. This paper develops a new renewable energy aware pricing scheme to achieve this target. We establish the proof that under certain assumptions the optimal solution of decentralized smart home scheduling is equivalent to that of the centralized technique, reaching the theoretical lower bound of the community wide total electricity bill. In addition, an advanced cross entropy optimization technique is proposed to compute the pricing scheme of renewable energy, which is then integrated in smart home scheduling. The simulation results demonstrate that our pricing scheme facilitates the reduction of both the community wide electricity bill and individual electricity bills compared to the uniform pricing. In particular, the community wide electricity bill can be reduced to only 0.06 percent above the theoretic lower bound.

"Abnormal accumulation of TDP-43 into cytoplasmic or nuclear inclusions with accompanying nuclear clearance, a common pathology initially identified in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), has also been found in Alzheimer' disease (AD). TDP-43 serves as a splicing repressor of non-conserved cryptic exons and that such function is compromised in brains of ALS and FTD patients, suggesting that nuclear clearance of TDP-43 underlies its inability to repress cryptic exons. However, whether TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregates are a prerequisite for the incorporation of cryptic exons is not known. Here, we assessed hippocampal tissues from 34 human postmortem brains including cases with confirmed diagnosis of AD neuropathologic changes along with age-matched controls. We found that cryptic exon incorporation occurred in all AD cases exhibiting TDP-43 pathology. Furthermore, incorporation of cryptic exons was observed in the hippocampus when TDP-43 inclusions was restricted only to the amygdala, the earliest stage of TDP-43 progression. Importantly, cryptic exon incorporation could be detected in AD brains lacking TDP-43 inclusion but exhibiting nuclear clearance of TDP-43. These data supports the notion that the functional consequence of nuclear depletion of TDP-43 as determined by cryptic exon incorporation likely occurs as an early event of TDP-43 proteinopathy and may have greater contribution to the pathogenesis of AD than currently appreciated. Early detection and effective repression of cryptic exons in AD patients may offer important diagnostic and therapeutic implications for this devastating illness of the elderly.

"Activating Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) mutations have been discovered in many T-cell malignancies, including anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs). However, such mutations occur in a minority of patients. To investigate the clinical application of targeting JAK for ALK-ALCL, we treated ALK-cell lines of various histological origins with JAK inhibitors. Interestingly, most exogenous cytokine-independent cell lines responded to JAK inhibition regardless of JAK mutation status. JAK inhibitor sensitivity correlated with the STAT3 phosphorylation status of tumor cells. Using retroviral shRNA knockdown, we have demonstrated that these JAK inhibitor-sensitive cells are dependent on both JAK1 and STAT3 for survival. JAK1 and STAT3 gain-of-function mutations were found in some, but not all, JAK inhibitor-sensitive cells. Moreover, the mutations alone cannot explain the JAK1/STAT3 dependency, given that wildtype JAK1 or STAT3 was sufficient to promote cell survival in the cells that had either JAK1or STAT3 mutations. To investigate whether other mechanisms were involved, we knocked down upstream receptors GP130 or IL-2R gamma. Knockdown of GP130 or IL-2R. induced cell death in selected JAK inhibitor-sensitive cells. High expression levels of cytokines, including IL-6, were demonstrated in cell lines as well as in primary ALK-ALCL tumors. Finally, ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, was effective in vivo in a xenograft ALK-ALCL model. Our data suggest that cytokine receptor signaling is required for tumor cell survival in diverse forms of ALK-ALCL, even in the presence of JAK1/STAT3 mutations. Therefore, JAK inhibitor therapy might benefit patients with ALK-ALCL who are phosphorylated STAT3(+).

"Alzheimer's disease is a complex progressive neurodegenerative brain disorder, being its prevalence expected to rise over the next decades. Unconventional strategies for elucidating the genetic mechanisms are necessary due to its polygenic nature. In this work, the input information sources are five: a public DNA microarray that measures expression levels of control and patient samples, repositories of known genes associated to Alzheimer's disease, additional data, Gene Ontology and finally, a literature review or expert knowledge to validate the results. As methodology to identify genes highly related to this disease, we present the integration of three machine learning techniques: particularly, we have used decision trees, quantitative association rules and hierarchical cluster to analyze Alzheimer's disease gene expression profiles to identify genes highly linked to this neurodegenerative disease, through changes in their expression levels between control and patient samples. We propose an ensemble of decision trees and quantitative association rules to find the most suitable configurations of the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm GarNet, in order to overcome the complex parametrization intrinsic to this type of algorithms. To fulfill this goat, GarNet has been executed using multiple configuration settings and the well-known C4.5 has been used to find the minimum accuracy to be satisfied. Then, GarNet is rerun to identify dependencies between genes and their expression levels, so we are able to distinguish between healthy individuals and Alzheimer's patients using the configurations that overcome the minimum threshold of accuracy defined by C4.5 algorithm. Finally, a hierarchical cluster analysis has been used to validate the obtained gene-Alzheimer's Disease associations provided by GarNet The results have shown that the obtained rules were able to successfully characterize the underlying information, grouping relevant genes for Alzheimer Disease. The genes reported by our approach provided two well defined groups that perfectly divided the samples between healthy and Alzheimer's Disease patients. To prove the relevance of the obtained results, a statistical test and gene expression fold-change were used. Furthermore, this relevance has been summarized in a volcano plot, showing two clearly separated and significant groups of genes that are up or down-regulated in Alzheimer's Disease patients. A biological knowledge integration phase was performed based on the information fusion of systematic literature review, enrichment Gene Ontology terms for the described genes found in the hippocampus of patients.

"A novel digital envelope modulator for envelope tracking radio frequency power amplifier is presented in this paper. The proposed modulator consists of a parallel combination of linear class AB and switching class D power amplifiers that are controlled digitally. In the previous analog architectures, the requirements needed for the AB operational amplifier such as high-current driving capability, high bandwidth and large output swing is usually obtainable at high overall static power dissipation. The digitally controlled power opamp presented here not only provides the aforementioned requirements but also reduces power dissipation compared with previous work. Furthermore, the digital control of the modulator makes it adaptive to the input signal variations in comparison with conventional analog parallel hybrid envelope modulators. The digital processor of the modulator is evaluated with a 45-nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology. The overall power consumption of the digital processor is around 142mW at 1.5-GHz clock frequency.

"Although quite recent as a forensic research domain, computer vision analysis of scenes is likely to become more and more important in the near future, thanks to its robustness to image alterations at the signal level, such as image compression and filtering. However, the experimental assessment of vision-based forensic algorithms is a particularly critical task, since they cannot be tested on massive amounts of data, and their performance can heavily depend on user skill. In this paper we investigate on the accuracy and reliability of a vision-based, user-supervised method for the estimation of the camera principal point, to be used in cropping and splicing detection. Results of an extensive experimental evaluation show how the estimation accuracy depends on perspective conditions as well as on the selected image features. Such evidence led us to define a novel visual feature, referred to as Minimum Vanishing Angle, which can be used to assess the reliability of the method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"A 53-year-old woman was diagnosed with hypopituitarism following an acute presentation with cardiac tamponade and hyponatraemia, having recently been investigated for a pericardial effusion. Secondary hypothyroidism is a rare cause of pericardial effusion and tamponade, but an important differential to consider. Management requires appropriate hormone replacement and, critically, a low threshold for commencing stress dose steroids. Clinical signs classically associated with cardiac tamponade are frequently absent in cases of tamponade due to primary and secondary hypothyroidism, and the relatively volume deplete state of secondary hypoadrenalism in hypopituitarism may further mask an evolving tamponade, as the rise in right atrial pressure is less marked even in the presence of large effusion. Our case demonstrates the importance of a high index of suspicion for cardiac tamponade in this patient cohort, even in the absence of clinical signs, and for measuring both thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine levels when evaluating a pericardial effusion.

"Aging is a cause of cognitive decline in the elderly and the major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, however, aging people are not all destined to develop into cognitive deficits, the molecular mechanisms underlying this difference in cognition of aging people are obscure. Epigenetic modifications, particularly histone acetylation in the nervous system, play a critical role in regulation of gene expression for learning and memory. An inhibitor of acetyltransferases (INHAT) is reported to suppress histone acetylation via a histone-masking mechanism, and pp32 is a key component of INHAT complex. In the present study, we divided 18 m-old aged mice into the cognitive-normal and the cognitive-impaired group by Morris water maze, and found that pp32 level was significantly increased in the hippocampus of cognitive-impaired aged mice. The mRNA and protein levels of synaptic-associated proteins decreased with reduced dendrite complexity and histone acetylation. Knockdown of pp32 rescued cognitive decline in cognitive-impaired aged mice with restoration of synaptic-associated proteins, the increase of spine density and elevation of histone acetylation. Our study reveals a novel mechanism underlying the aging-associated cognitive disturbance, indicating that suppression of pp32 might represent a promising therapeutic approach for learning and memory impairments.

"A research has been carried out on the dynamic analysis and simulation of parallel robots due to the situation where parallel robots tend to break down on account of large stress during movements. In order to study the force condition of the robot on the move, a mathematical model, based on the Kane method, has been built and the driving force of each electric cylinder has been calculated by computer programming. In the meantime, a dynamic simulation model and a simulation control system are established on the basis of Adams and Matlab and through analyzing the joint simulation, we can obtain the driving force of each cylinder. The gap between the simulation results and the results obtained by the mathematical model is within 7%, which verifies the correctness of the Kane dynamic system and gives provide the foundation for future studies of dynamics and structure optimization.

"3D modeling is used in Computer Graphics in various fields. Since the growth of gestures, virtual reality and embodied cognition, there have been various new technologies developed to either improve the modeling efficiency, or to provide more nature intuitive experience to the users. In this paper, from the user experience perspective, we try to compare these methods for navigation of 3D objects in the virtual modeling environment including: simple bare hand gestures, tangible user interfaces (TUI) with object in hand, as well as mouse/keyboard as the primary input. Based on embodied cognition theory, we hypothesis that the object-in-hand method might bring better user experience since the interaction between the object and hand can enhance the user's cognition while navigating a model. We present a conceptual design, with two approaches and three design models which demonstrate differences in user interaction with 3D modeling software.

"A robust multi-objective optimization method for truss optimum design is presented. In the robust design, materials and loads are assumed to be affected by epistemic uncertainties (imprecise or lack of knowledge). Uncertainty quantification using evidence theory in optimum design subject to epistemic uncertainty is undertaken. In addition to a functional objective, an evidence-based plausibility measure of failure of constraint satisfaction is minimized to formulate the robust design into a multi-objective optimization problem. In order to alleviate the computational difficulties in the evidence theory-based uncertainty quantification analysis, a combined strategy of differential evolution-based interval optimization method and parallel computing technique is proposed. A population-based multi-objective differential evolution optimization algorithm is designed for searching robust Pareto front. Two truss structures with shape and sizing optimum design problems are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method.

"Advances in high-throughput proteomics have led to a rapid increase in the number, size, and complexity of the associated data sets. Managing and extracting reliable information from such large series of data sets require the use of dedicated software organized in a consistent pipeline to reduce, validate, exploit, and ultimately export data. The compilation of multiple mass-spectrometry-based identification and quantification results obtained in the context of a large-scale project represents a real challenge for developers of bioinformatics solutions. In response to this challenge, we developed a dedicated software suite called hEIDI to manage and combine both identifications and semiquantitative data related to multiple LCMS/MS analyses. This paper describes how, through a user-friendly interface, hEIDI can be used to compile analyses and retrieve lists of nonredundant protein groups. Moreover, hEIDI allows direct comparison of series of analyses, on the basis of protein groups, while ensuring consistent protein inference and also computing spectral counts. hEIDI ensures that validated results are compliant with MIAPE guidelines as all information related to samples and results is stored in appropriate databases. Thanks to the database structure, validated results generated within hEIDI can be easily exported in the PRIDE XML format for subsequent publication. hEIDI can be downloaded from http://biodev.extra.cea.fr/docs/heidi.

"A prototype wearable exoskeleton having three degrees of freedom is presented in this paper. The design considers multiple user acceptance criteria and functional requirements with the aim to facilitate robotic-assisted in-home rehabilitation therapy. Actuation modules containing shape memory alloy (SMA) wires, mechanical amplification and position sensors are designed to meet work requirements during activities of daily living. Modules containing differential configuration and spring bias configuration are built and presented. Kinematic and dynamic models are presented. A simplified material model which relates the system inputs to the SMA strain rate is derived and validated using open loop tracking results. This is combined with a gain scheduled servo-loop for disturbance rejection to create a feedforward controller. Mo dules and controller showed reasonable results tracking sinusoidal trajectories, with friction and controller parameters contributing to velocity instability. The theory of stiffness control in differential configuration and the requirement for control of the heating and cooling rates is presented. Miniature fans are fitted to control the cooling rate however this was unsuccessful probably due to the dominance of conduction heat transfer within the design. The modular actuators are tested while extracted from the exoskeleton design. The results lead to the conclusion that the following aspects require improvement before testing proceeds on a user: 1) integration of force sensors into the control loop, 2) hardware which improves the controlled cooling rate, 3) qualitative analysis of friction in the system.

"A well-known practice to accelerate construction projects is to overlap the design phase activities. For a typical construction project, a number of overlapping strategies exist during the design phase which all can result in timesaving. However, the cost of these strategies varies significantly depending on the total rework and complexity they generate. A favorable overlapping strategy is one that generates the required timesaving at the minimum cost. To find such a strategy, the question ""Which activities have to be overlapped and to what extent to reduce the project duration at the minimum cost?"" should be answered. This research aimed at answering the question through generating an overlapping optimization algorithm. The algorithm works based on the principles of genetic algorithms (GAs). The algorithm explained in the paper is unique compared to previous algorithms and frameworks available in the literature, as it can optimize multi-path networks and can handle all types of activity dependencies (i.e. finish-to-start, start-to-start, and finish-to-finish). It also takes both critical and non-critical activities into account and follows the critical path if the critical path changes or new critical paths emerge. A computer tool was also developed to run, examine and validate the overlapping optimization algorithm. This paper introduces the algorithm and the computer tool in detail and explains the results of their validation through optimizing a real-world project schedule. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"A 59-year-old Italian woman came to our center for revaluation of a previous diagnosis of polycythemia vera. The patient presented with a lifelong history of polycythemia, no increase in white blood cells (WBCs) and platelets, and a negative bone marrow biopsy. Analysis of hemoglobin (Hb) fractions showed an abnormal fast moving Hb component. We aimed to determine if this variant was the cause of polycythemia in this patient. A complete blood count (CBC) was performed by an automated cell counter and Hb fractions were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Standard stability tests and oxygen affinity evaluation were also performed. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using the phenol chloroform method and the entire -globin gene was analyzed by direct sequencing. At the hematological level, no anemia or hemolysis was observed but an abnormal Hb fraction was detected using cation exchange HPLC. Molecular analysis of the -globin gene showed heterozygosity for an AAG>ACG substitution at codon 144, resulting in a LysThr amino acid replacement. We demonstrated that this is a new Hb variant with increased oxygen affinity. Its altered physiology is caused by the reduction of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) effects, due to an amino acid substitution in the central pocket near the C-terminal of the chain. We called this new variant Hb San Cataldo for the native city of proband.

"A parameterized string (p-string) is a generalization of the traditional string over two alphabets: a constant alphabet and a parameter alphabet. A parameterized match (pmatch) exists between two p-strings if the constants match exactly and if there exists a bijection between the parameter symbols. Historically, p-strings have been leveraged for source code cloning, plagiarism detection, and biological sequence structural similarity. In this work, we identify the connection between the p-match and music, one of several applications to motivate our study of holes in p-strings, and prefix array-based data structures for p-strings. First, we introduce the parameterized prefix array (pPA) for pstrings and its succinct representation, the compact parameterized prefix array (cpPA). We show an interesting construction of the cpPA via the parameterized longest previous factor (pLPF), a more recently proposed array with connections to various pattern matching data structures and LZ factorization. Next, we introduce the parameterized string with holes (hp-string), needed to address a special form of indeterminate pattern matching with pstrings. Then, we show how to construct the compact prefix array for hp-strings. Finally, we discuss applications for our data structures. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"A large set of decimetric and microwave observations of solar millisecond radio spikes is compared and correlated with simultaneous hard X-ray observations in the 25-438 keV range, recorded by the Hard X-Ray Burst Spectrometer (HXRBS) on board the Solar Maximum Mission satellite. Radio spikes have time scales of 20-200 ms, while hard X-ray bursts rarely show fine structures shorter than 1 s. The main conclusions of a statistical analysis of a) the association rate, b) the correlation degree, and c) relative time delays between hard X-ray and radio spike emissions, are: 1) Radio spike bursts reveal the highest hard X-ray association rate of any kind of coherent solar radio emission; approximately 95% of the observed events occur during (mostly impulsive) hard X-ray bursts. Conversely, almost-equal-to 2% of all HXRBS flares produce radio millisecond spike bursts. 2) Spike bursts are preferentially associated with the impulsive phase of the hard X-ray event; about half of all observations are closely associated with the main peak of a simultaneous X-ray event. 3) We find a significant temporal correlation between spike clusters and hard X-ray events. About 43% of the compared events show hard X-ray time profiles that mimic the concentration of simultaneous radio spikes. This also holds for small fluctuations with time scales of the order of a few seconds. 4) The durations of spike events and associated hard X-ray bursts closely correlate, the X-ray bursts being somewhat longer than the radio events. 5) The radio emission is usually delayed in respect to hard X-ray bursts, typically a few seconds. The relative delays seem to be restricted to the following rules: The radio event usually starts before the peak time of the hard X-ray event (73 out of 84 cases), and similarly, the X-ray burst almost always starts before the maximum of spike burst activity (83 out of 84 cases). This is shown to hold for a wide range of burst durations. We have not found any convincing relation concerning the relative time differences of the end times, however. 6) The observed delays of the order of several seconds put some constraints on the acceleration and propagation of particles. The delays are found to be incompatible with the build-up time of a loss-cone distribution (for maser emission) by an order of magnitude, if the, same population of electrons is responsible for radio and X-ray radiation. Rather, considering the smallness of the radio spike sources, the proportionality of the X-ray flux with the spike rate, and the spatial 'spread of a propagating electron population, it is argued that both the time delays and the quantization into discrete radio events are caused by the operation of the accelerator.

Here we use the 6year record of an improved sea ice thickness product retrieved from data fusion of CryoSat-2 radar altimetry and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity radiometry measurements to examine the impact of recent temperature trend on the Arctic ice mass balance. Between November 2015 and March 2016, we find a consistent drop of cumulative freezing degree days across the Arctic, with a negative peak anomaly of about 1000 degree days in the Barents Sea, coinciding with an Arctic-wide average thinning of 10cm in March with respect to the 6year average. In particular, the loss of ice volume is associated with a significant decline of March first-year ice volume by 13%. This reveals that due to the loss of multiyear ice during previous years, the Arctic ice cover becomes more sensitive to climate anomalies.

"A steam gasification processes is an energy conversion pathway through which organic materials are converted to useful energy. In spite of the high energy content in organic waste materials, they have been mostly disposed of in landfills, which causes harmful environmental issues such as methane emissions and ground water pollution and contaminations. In this sense, organic solid waste materials are regarded as alternative resources for conversion to useful energy in the steam gasification process. In this study, three types of waste materials - municipal solid waste (MSW), used tires and sewage sludge - were used to generate syngas through the gasification process in a 1000 degrees C steam atmosphere. The syngas generation rates and its chemical compositions were measured and evaluated over time to determine the characteristics and dynamics of the gasification process. Also, carbon conversion, and mass and energy balances are presented which demonstrates the feasibility of steam gasification as a waste conversion pathway. The results show that the syngas contains high concentrations of H-2, around 41-55% by volume. The syngas generation rate was found to depend on the carbon content in the feedstock regardless of the types of input materials. Comparing to the hydrogen production from water splitting that requires extremely high temperatures at around 1500 degrees C, hydrogen production by steam gasification of organic materials can be regarded as equally effective but requires lower system temperatures.

"A multifunctional catalyst electrode mimicking external stimuli-responsive property has been prepared by the in situ growth of nitrogen (N)-doped NiFe double layered hydroxide (N-NiFe LDH) nanolayers on a 3D nickel foam substrate framework. The electrode demonstrates superior performance toward catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction (OER), affording a low overpotential of 0.23 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), high Faradaic efficiency of approximate to 98%, and stable operation for >60 h. Meanwhile, the electrode can dynamically change its color from gray silver to dark black with the OER happening, and the coloration/bleaching processes persist for at least 5000 cycles, rendering it a useful tool to monitor the catalytic process. Mechanism study reveals that the excellent structural properties of electrode such as 3D conductive framework, ultra thickness of N-NiFe LDH nanolayer (approximate to 0.8 nm), and high N-doping content (approximate to 17.8%) make significant contribution to achieving enhanced catalytic performance, while N-NiFe LDH nanolayer on electrode is the main contributor to the stimuli-responsive property with the reversible extraction/insertion of electrons from/into N-NiFe LDH leading to the coloration/bleaching processes. Potential application of this electrode has been further demonstrated by integrating it into a Zn-air battery device to identify the charging process during electrochemical cycling.

This study considers 216 patients from the European Epilepsy Database, and includes 185 patients with scalp EEG recordings and 31 with intracranial data. The strategy was tested over a total of 16,729.80 h of inter-ictal data, including 1206 seizures. We found an overall sensitivity of 38.47% and a false positive rate per hour of 0.20.

Our study presents a prospective analysis of a large heterogeneous, multicentric dataset. The statistical framework based on conservative assumptions, reflects a realistic approach compared to constrained datasets, and/or in-sample evaluations. The improvement of these results, with the definition of an appropriate set of features able to improve the distinction between the pre-ictal and nonpre-ictal states, hence minimizing the effect of confounding variables, remains a key aspect.

"A Summary The appropriate time to initiate bisphosphonate treatment after a fragility fracture has not yet been established. In this study, we found no significant differences in short-term functional recovery between femoral neck fracture patients who received bisphosphonate treatment at 2 versus 12 weeks after hemiarthroplasty. Introduction Bisphosphonate is the mainstay therapy for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of bisphosphonate initiation on short-term functional recovery in femoral neck fracture patients at 2 versus 12 weeks after hemiarthroplasty. Methods One hundred patients were randomly allocated into two groups in a parallel group designed, randomized, controlled trial. Both groups received risedronate 35 mg/week at either 2 or 12 weeks after hemiarthroplasty. All patients received calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Functional recovery was assessed by de Morton Mobility Index, Barthel Index, EuroQol 5D, visual analog scale, 2-min walk test, and timed get-up-and-go test at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year after surgery. Results At the 3-month follow-up, all functional outcome measures showed significant improvement in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences in any of the functional outcomes between groups at both the 3-month and 1-year follow-ups. Although patients who received bisphosphonate initiation at week 2 had lower serum calcium level at 3 months and more overall adverse events than patients in the week 12 group, no patients in either group discontinued their prescribed medications. Conclusions While underpowered, the findings of this study suggest that there were no significant differences in short-term functional recovery or significant adverse events between the two bisphosphonate groups. Thus, the initiation of bisphosphonate therapy may be considered as early as 2 weeks after femoral neck fracture. It is important that low serum calcium and vitamin D status must be corrected with calcium and vitamin D supplementation prior to or at the time of bisphosphonate initiation.

"Adolescence is a time of continued brain maturation, particularly in limbic and cortical regions, which undoubtedly plays a role in the physiological and emotional changes. Prenatally stressed offspring rats were used to investigate the potential antidepressive-like effects of imperatorin (IMP) extracted from the root of radix angelica. After 4 weeks of treatment of IMP, behavioral tests (sucrose-preference test, forced-swimming test, and open-field test) were measured. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentration in the hippocampus and frontal cortex was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serotonin transporters (5-HTT) and 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1AR) mRNA expression in the hippocampus and frontal cortex were also determined by real-time PCR. Administration with IMP (15 and 30 mg/kg/day, intragastrically) for 28 days markedly increased the percentage of sucrose (anhedonia), decreased the immobility time, and increased the number of total crossings, center crossings, rearing, and grooming in the male prenatally stressed offspring. Meanwhile, we found that 5-HT concentration in the hippocampus and frontal cortex was significantly increased in the IMP-treated group. Subsequently, we found significantly decreased 5-HTT and increased 5-HT1AR mRNA expressions in the hippocampus and frontal cortex after IMP treatment in the prenatally stressed male offspring. IMP showed antidepressive-like effects and increased 5-HT concentration in male prenatally stressed offspring, suggesting that IMP could be of therapeutic use in preventing depressive-like behavior in adolescence.

"Accurate condition assessment of in-service infrastructure systems is critical for system-wide prioritization decisions. Current protocols require lengthy inspections and expensive equipment to examine large infrastructure systems. Furthermore, changes in inspection protocols over time can create discontinuities in recording and understanding the time history of a structure. To address these challenges, a systematic and adaptive technique for converting two-dimensional (2D) digital images into three-dimensional (3D) models has been developed, with the goal of creating high-resolution and scale-accurate inspection records. The developed reconstruction technique utilizes multiscale imaging to reconstruct a structure with varying levels of details and geometric complexity. The captured images are then converted into photorealistic, accurate, and dense 3D scene reconstructions by utilizing a hierarchical adaptation of a dense structure-from-motion (DSfM) algorithm. The result of this approach is a virtual 3D model of the structure with accurate geometry and high-fidelity representation of fine details. The accuracy, completeness, adaptability, and feasibility of the developed method were compared to both terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) and conventional DSfM methods. Experimental findings and direct comparison between generated point clouds indicate that the developed hierarchical technique consistently produces dense point clouds capable of resolving 0.1-mm details, an order of magnitude improvement over existing methods. The developed technique also allows for user-controlled point cloud density, a significant benefit over current reconstruction methods. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

"Although there is a strong focus on NoSQL databases for cloud computing environments, traditional relational data bases are still an integral part of many computing services in the cloud. Two significant issues in managing a relational database in a cloud environment are handling the inevitable evolution of the database schema and managing changes to system configuration and other data stored in the database as the system evolves over time. Techniques for handling these issues in on-premise databases are much less feasible in cloud computing environments, which demand efficiency, elasticity, and scalability. We propose a versioning system that can be used in relational databases to allow new versions of the database schema and data to be maintained within the same database as the production data. Past research on versioning either handles data versioning but not schema changes, or handles both but is focused on OLAP or XML databases. In this paper, we describe a mechanism for storing concurrent versions of data in an OLTP database. We explore two different implementation alternatives for versioned data storage and evaluate their relative merits given different workloads. We provide a concrete description of how this can be implemented within the InnoDB storage engine, which is the default data store for MySQL databases, and we present a quantitative comparison of the two implementations in InnoDB.

Smokers tend to identify more strongly with African American culture. Qualitative interviews were conducted to elicit perceptions toward smoking and intervention content. Seventy-one African American smokers recruited from community locations participated. The majority stated they would not use any cessation aids if trying to quit smoking, despite the availability of free nicotine replacement. Acculturative stress scores were significantly higher in younger participants and those with higher income. Higher African American acculturation did not predict smoking cessation intervention preference. Family and social relationships were cited as both reasons for wanting to quit and reasons for continuing to smoke. Based on these findings, interventions for urban African Americans should address household members continuing to smoke, social/family connections, stress management, and cultural identification in urban areas.

"Algorithmic music composition is concerned with generation of music through algorithms. Using natural language text as the basis for generation opens up interesting ideas for research. We have identified three strategies for mapping text to music: using all the letters, using only vowels and using vowels in conjunction with the word's part of speech (POS). The third approach is best achieved with a full parse tree since it helps in identifying the most probable POS tag. Using text input and applying these strategies, we derive a sequence of notes (pitches) as well as the rhythm (note durations). Punctuation symbols in the input text are mapped to Rest. To achieve greater flexibility with the composition, instead of directly mapping to concrete notes, we use relativized note indices and combine these with Scale, Key and Octave parameters to determine the actual note. Our music composition library is implemented in Wolfram's Mathematica, a popular symbolic computation environment. For parsing the input text we use J/Link to make call-outs to Apache OpenNLP library. In this paper, we describe our strategies in detail and suggest possible areas for future work.

The real implementation of such concepts is based on the use of new technology and innovative ways of development. Agent Oriented Software Engineering techniques and concepts have been used as a way of providing support to ubiquitous computing and communication. In addition, intelligent user interfaces require systems that provide a more efficient and rich interface with the user than the traditional ones. This paper presents a platform called MAPAS, which uses Ambient Intelligence concepts and techniques to give a fully scalable solution to a particular problem. The chosen system provides a solution, using the platform, to personalize the dissemination of events, that is, the system makes available to the user a set of events of his/her interest. This kind of systems requires a high degree of user's personalization. However nowadays, it is the user who must search the events of interest or subscribe to several different services or pages. The platform introduced in this paper takes profit of Agent Oriented technology to provide a system composed of various agents who may run in different devices, which communicate and provide a user personalized selection of events. Moreover, the system is aware of the surrounding environment, can be installed on smart devices, provides a rich and intuitive user interface and uses Augmented Reality techniques to give spatial location data about the events. Regarding the characteristics of the solution, it seems to be suitable for problems in the domain of Ambient Intelligence.

"AIM To assess the impact of underlying liver disease etiology on the presenting features and outcomes in a large cohort of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS A prospective database of all patients with HCC was established from 1998 to March 2012. One thousand and seventy-eight patients were categorized into three groups, based on the etiology of their liver disease: hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and non-viral liver disease (NVLD). Overall survival was determined by Kaplan Meier analysis to time of death or last follow-up. RESULTS HCC patients with HCV (85%) were more likely to be diagnosed as part of a surveillance program, compared to HBV or NVLD (both 71%) (p < 0.001). Patients with NVLD were more likely to receive best supportive care (29%) compared to those with HBV (21%) or HCV (20%) (p < 0.02). Twelve percent of NVLD and 13% of HBV patients underwent liver transplantation compared to 21% of HCV patients (p = 0.001). Median survival from presentation was lowest in NVLD (1.7 years) when compared to HBV (2.8 years) and HCV (2.6 years) (p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, independent predictors of survival included Child Turcotte Pugh score, size of dominant lesion, absence of vascular invasion, and management with surgical resection or liver transplantation. Patient age and the etiology of the underlying liver disease were not independent predictors of survival CONCLUSION Patients with NVLD and HCC were less likely to be enrolled in a HCC surveillance program and are less likely to have curative therapies such as liver resection and transplantation after diagnosis with HCC, when compared to patients with Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C.

The system was tested in navigation on social network Facebook, where an average speed of 382 pixels / s was obtained, with an average accuracy of 22 pixels for the X axis and 17 pixels for the Y axis. However, after user interaction with the interface, improvements of 23% and 37% were observed, in execution time and location accuracy, respectively. Click activation by temporary location over a menu option had a performance of 100%; while the right and left clicks by eyelid closing had a performance of 93% and 92%, respectively. Finally, the surveys showed high satisfaction about the proposed interface during user interaction with Facebook.

"A mechatronic based embedded digital draft force and wheel slip measuring devices was developed. It includes a load cell based dynamometer to measure the draft force, hall sensor based magnetic pins mounted discs to measure wheel slip, an amplifier to amplify the sensing unit signals of dynamometer, and a microcontroller to process the received load cells, hall sensors data to calculate draft force, wheel slip and display on the LCD screen as well as record the data in SD card module. To compare and assess the degree of accuracy of the developed draft measurement system, wheel slip measurement system, a system involving instrumented three point linkages was developed to measure draft force simultaneously and a non contact type radar sensor was used to validate the wheel slip measurement system. It was observed that, a maximum variation of +/- 410 N draft forces was observed between the developed and strain gauge dynamometer also found close to draft force values calculated by ASABE equation and a maximum variation of +/- 2.1% wheel slip was observed between developed and manual measured values. The developed devices are simple in construction and can be mounted on any make and model of agricultural tractor implements. The developed devices will be very much helpful for educational institutions and research needs in drawbar performance studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The two geotextiles are mechanically bonded in a needlepunching process to produce a hybrid geotextile on a commercial scale. The fuzzy woven side of the geotextile, resulting from the needlepunching process, is ideally suited for lamination to a geonet, although a standalone filter application is also possible. Filter press tests on the geotextile against a fly ash slurry of 500% yielded a retention efficiency of 99.6%. Gradient ratio values of 1.0-1.5 and hydraulic conductivity ratio values of 0.5-1.0 were obtained against fly ash and FGD gypsum from four power plants. Four field basin tests were performed under the CCRs wherein effluent parameters of total suspended solids, total dissolved solids, turbidity, conductivity and pH were monitored with time. The field tests showed that the fly ash and FGD gypsum contained in the test basins were not migrating with time. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"A global map of drought risk has been elaborated at the sub-national administrative level. The motivation for this study is the observation that little research and no concerted efforts have been made at the global level to provide a consistent and equitable drought risk management framework for multiple regions, population groups and economic sectors. Drought risk is assessed for the period 20002014 and is based on the product of three independent determinants: hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Drought hazard is derived from a non-parametric analysis of historical precipitation deficits at the 0.5; drought exposure is based on a non-parametric aggregation of gridded indicators of population and livestock densities, crop cover and water stress; and drought vulnerability is computed as the arithmetic composite of high level factors of social, economic and infrastructural indicators, collected at both the national and sub-national levels. The performance evaluation of the proposed models underlines their statistical robustness and emphasizes an empirical resemblance between the geographic patterns of potential drought impacts and previous results presented in the literature. Our findings support the idea that drought risk is driven by an exponential growth of regional exposure, while hazard and vulnerability exhibit a weaker relationship with the geographic distribution of risk values. Drought risk is lower for remote regions, such as tundras and tropical forests, and higher for populated areas and regions extensively exploited for crop production and livestock farming, such as South-Central Asia, Southeast of South America, Central Europe and Southeast of the United States. As climate change projections foresee an increase of drought frequency and intensity for these regions, then there is an aggravated risk for global food security and potential for civil conflict in the medium- to long-term. Since most agricultural regions show high infrastructural vulnerability to drought, then regional adaptation to climate change may begin through implementing and fostering the widespread use of irrigation and rainwater harvesting systems. In this context, reduction in drought risk may also benefit from diversifying regional economies on different sectors of activity and reducing the dependence of their GDP on agriculture.

"Although the importance of cellular forces to a wide range of embryogenesis and disease processes is widely recognized, measuring these forces is challenging, especially in three dimensions. Here, we introduce CellFIT-3D, a force inference technique that allows tension maps for three-dimensional cellular systems to be estimated from image stacks. Like its predecessors, video force microscopy and CellFIT, this cell mechanics technique assumes boundary-specific interfacial tensions to be the primary drivers, and it constructs force-balance equations based on triple junction (TJ) dihedral angles. The technique involves image processing, segmenting of cells, grouping of cell outlines, calculation of dihedral planes, averaging along three-dimensional TJs, and matrix equation assembly and solution. The equations tend to be strongly overdetermined, allowing indistinct TJs to be ignored and solution error estimates to be determined. Application to clean and noisy synthetic data generated using Surface Evolver gave tension errors of 1.6-7%, and analyses of eight-cell murine embryos gave estimated errors smaller than the 10% uncertainty of companion aspiration experiments. Other possible areas of application include morphogenesis, cancer metastasis and tissue engineering.

"2-dimensional (2D) nanosheets such as graphene, graphene oxide, boron nitride or transition metal dichalcogenides can be produced on a large scale by exfoliation techniques. The lateral shape of these 2D materials is typically considered random and irregular, and their average size is often estimated using techniques characterized by strong approximations or poor statistical significance. Here we measure in a quantitative, objective way the size and shape of 2D monoatomic nanosheets using a combination of optical, electronic and scanning probe techniques. We measure, one by one, the size and shape of thousands of sheets of graphene oxide as they undergo a standard ultrasonication treatment. Using automatic image processing and statistical modelling we identify two different fragmentation processes in 2D at the nanoscale, related to two populations of nanosheets described by gamma and exponential size distributions respectively. The two populations of sheets coexist during the fragmentation process, each one retaining its average size and shape. Our results explain the size reduction commonly observed in nanosheets upon sonication as an effect of changes in the respective weights of the two populations of nanosheets present in the material.

"Accurate and timely knowledge is critical in intelligent transportation system (ITS) as it leads to improved traffic flow management. The knowledge of the past can be useful for the future as traffic patterns normally follow a predictable pattern with respect to time of day, and day of week. In this paper, we systematically evaluated the prediction accuracy and speed of several supervised machine learning algorithms towards congestion identification based on six weeks real-world traffic data from August 1st, 2012 to September 12th, 2012 in the Maryland (MD)/Washington DC, and Virginia (VA) area. Our dataset consists of six months traffic data pattern from July 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012, of which 6 weeks was used as a representative sample for the purposes of this study on our reference roadway -I-270 [2-4]. Our experimental data shows that with respect to classification, classification tree (Ctree) could provide the best prediction accuracy with an accuracy rate of 100% and prediction speed of 0.34 seconds. It is pertinent to note that variations exist respecting prediction accuracy and prediction speed; hence, a tradeoff is often necessary respecting the priority of the applications in question.

"A In this paper, a robust control approach is used to address the problem of adaptive behavioral treatment design. Human behavior (e.g., smoking and exercise) and reactions to treatment are complex and depend on many unmeasurable external stimuli, some of which are unknown. Thus, it is crucial to model human behavior over many subject responses. We propose a simple (low order) uncertain affine model subject to uncertainties whose response covers the most probable behavioral responses. The proposed model contains two different types of uncertainties: uncertainty of the dynamics and external perturbations that patients face in their daily life. Once the uncertain model is defined, we demonstrate how least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) can be used as an identification tool. The lasso algorithm provides a way to directly estimate a model subject to sparse perturbations. With this estimated model, a robust control algorithm is developed, where one relies on the special structure of the uncertainty to develop efficient optimization algorithms. This paper concludes by using the proposed algorithm in a numerical experiment that simulates treatment for the urge to smoke.

"A ground cover rice production system (GCRPS) has been reported to reduce the consumption of irrigation water while increasing grain yield and water use efficiency in regions where water and temperature are limiting factors for rice production. However, all fertilizer must be applied in a single basal dose before the soil surface is covered by plastic film in GCRPS resulting in excessive vegetative crop growth and nitrogen deficiency during the reproductive stage. Furthermore, a severe drawback of GCRPS is soil and water pollution from residuals polyethylene film used for ground cover. A two-year field experiment was conducted using biodegradable film together with treatments comparing all basal application of N with application of N as three splits and a single basal fertilization of urea plus manure. We examined N uptake and crop growth from transplanting harvest, rice grain yield, yield components, dynamics of tillers and shoot dry matter, and N recovery efficiency. Compared to basal application of all N fertilizer in GCRPS, split application of N or a basal combination of urea plus manure in conjunction with the use of biodegradable film 1) significantly increased rice grain yield, number of productive tillers, and spikelets per square meter; 2) improved crop growth rate and N uptake rate from panicle initiation to maturity; and 3) significantly increased agronomic efficiency of N fertilizer and recovery efficiency of N in grains. Our results highlight that using biodegradable film instead of standard plastic film allows for split application of fertilizers, which increases yield and N use efficiency as well as significantly reduce environmental pollution with plastic film in GCRPS.

"A crucial step in the use of DNA markers for biodiversity surveys is the assignment of Linnaean taxonomies (species, genus, etc.) to sequence reads. This allows the use of all the information known based on the taxonomic names. Taxonomic placement of DNA barcoding sequences is inherently probabilistic because DNA sequences contain errors, because there is natural variation among sequences within a species, and because reference data bases are incomplete and can have false annotations. However, most existing bioinformatics methods for taxonomic placement either exclude uncertainty, or quantify it using metrics other than probability. In this paper we evaluate the performance of the recently proposed probabilistic taxonomic placement method PROTAX by applying it to both annotated reference sequence data as well as to unknown environmental data. Our four case studies include contrasting taxonomic groups (fungi, bacteria, mammals and insects), variation in the length and quality of the barcoding sequences (from individually Sanger-sequenced sequences to short Illumina reads), variation in the structures and sizes of the taxonomies (800-130000 species) and variation in the completeness of the reference data bases (representing 15-100% of known species). Our results demonstrate that PROTAX yields essentially unbiased probabilities of taxonomic placement, which means its quantification of species identification uncertainty is reliable. As expected, the accuracy of taxonomic placement increases with increasing coverage of taxonomic and reference sequence data bases, and with increasing ratio of genetic variation among taxonomic levels over within taxonomic levels. We conclude that reliable species-level identification from environmental samples is still challenging and that neglecting identification uncertainty can lead to spurious inference. A key aim for future research is the completion of taxonomic and reference sequence data bases and making these two types of data compatible.

"Ad hoc networks are subject to multiple challenges, particularly the problem of limited resources such as energy and vulnerability in terms of security. Indeed, the nodes are subject to various attacks and malicious actions. Thus, each mobile is confronted with a dilemma: cooperate to ensure security, in this case the node spend a part of its energy, or not cooperate which allows it to save energy but making the security of the network more vulnerable. In this work, we develop an approach which takes into account two conflicting objectives: contribute to network security while reducing energy consumption. The approach is based on alternating two steps: Clustering-Evolutionary game. The clustering step is performed by an algorithm that takes into account the energy constraint in election of cluster-heads. The interactions between each pair of cluster-heads, when exchanging data, in their contribution to the security of the network, are modeled as an evolutionary game which is the second step of the proposed approach.

"A variable number tandem repeat polymorphism (VNTR) in the period 3 (PER3) gene has been associated with heritable sleep and circadian variables, including self-rated chronotypes, polysomnographic (PSG) variables, insomnia and circadian sleep-wake disorders. This report describes novel molecular and clinical analyses of PER3 VNTR polymorphisms to better define their functional consequences. As the PER3 VNTR is located in the exonic (protein coding) region of PER3, we initially investigated whether both alleles (variants) are transcribed into messenger RNA in human fibroblasts. The VNTR showed bi-allelic gene expression. We next investigated genetic associations in relation to clinical variables in 274 older adult Caucasian individuals. Independent variables included genotypes for the PER3 VNTR as well as a representative set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that tag common variants at the PER3 locus (linkage disequilibrium (LD) between genetic variants < 0.5). In order to comprehensively evaluate variables analyzed individually in prior analyses, dependent measures included PSG total sleep time and sleep latency, self-rated chronotype, estimated with the Composite Scale (CS), and lifestyle regularity, estimated using the social rhythm metric (SRM). Initially, genetic polymorphisms were individually analyzed in relation to each outcome variable using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Nominally significant associations were further tested using regression analyses that incorporated individual ANOVA-associated DNA variants as potential predictors and each of the selected sleep/circadian variables as outcomes. The covariates included age, gender, body mass index and an index of medical co-morbidity. Significant genetic associations with the VNTR were not detected with the sleep or circadian variables. Nominally significant associations were detected between SNP rs1012477 and CS scores (p = 0.003) and between rs10462021 and SRM (p = 0.047); rs11579477 and average delta power (p = 0.043) (analyses uncorrected for multiple comparisons). In conclusion, alleles of the VNTR are expressed at the transcript level and may have a functional effect in cells expressing the PER3 gene. PER3 polymorphisms had a modest impact on selected sleep/circadian variables in our sample, suggesting that PER3 is associated with sleep and circadian function beyond VNTR polymorphisms. Further replicate analyses in larger, independent samples are recommended.

"A diversity of synthetic cathinones has flooded the recreational drug marketplace worldwide. This variety is often a response to legal control actions for one specific compound (e.g. methcathinone) which has resulted in the emergence of closely related replacement. Based on recent trends, the nitrogen atom is one of the sites in the cathinone molecule being explored by designer type modifications. In this study, we designed and synthesized two new synthetic cathinones, (1) alpha-piperidinopropiophenone (PIPP) and (2) alpha-piperidinopentiothiophenone (PIVT), which have piperidine ring substituent on their nitrogen atom. Thereafter, we evaluated whether these two compounds have an abuse potential through the conditioned place preference (CPP) in mice and self-administration (SA) in rats. We also investigated whether the substances can induce locomotor sensitization in mice following 7 days daily injection and challenge. qRT-PCR analyses were conducted to determine their effects on dopamine-related genes in the striatum. PIPP (10 and 30 mg/kg) induced CPP in mice, but not PIVT. However, both synthetic cathinones were not self-administered by the rats and did not induce locomotor sensitization in mice. qRT-PCR analyses showed that PIPP, but not PIVT, reduced dopamine transporter gene expression in the striatum. These data indicate that PIPP, but not PIVT, has rewarding effects, which may be attributed to its ability to affect dopamine transporter gene expression. Altogether, this study suggests that PIPP may have abuse potential. Careful monitoring of this type of cathinone and related drugs are advocated.

"A non-contact type force actuator is necessary for studying the dynamic performance of a high-speed spindle system owing to its high-speed operating conditions. A non-contact electromagnetic exciter is designed for identifying the dynamic coefficients of journal bearings in high-speed grinding spindles. A linear force control method is developed based on PID controller. The influence of amplitude and frequency of current, misalignment and rotational speed on magnetic field and excitation force is investigated based on two-dimensional finite element analysis. The electromagnetic excitation force is measured with the auxiliary coils and calibrated by load cells. The design is validated by the experimental results. Theoretical and experimental investigations show that the proposed design can accurately generate linear excitation force with sufficiently large amplitude and higher signal to noise ratio. Moreover, the fluctuations in force amplitude are reduced to a greater extent with the designed linear control method even when the air gap changes due to the rotor vibration at high-speed conditions. Besides, it is possible to apply various types of excitations: constant, synchronous, and non-synchronous excitation forces based on the proposed linear control method. This exciter can be used as linear-force exciting and controlling system for dynamic performance study of different high-speed rotor-bearing systems.

"An important factor that governs solar energy transformation into electrical or chemical energy, when using nanoparticles-based devices, is the spatial location of traps limiting electron transport. Evidences have been presented indicating that the electron diffusion is strongly influenced by nanoparticle boundaries, whose characteristics depend on the particles preparation. In the present work we have studied the role of hydrated excess proton structures in the formation of anatase nanoparticles boundaries in samples prepared by TiCl4 hydrolysis at low temperature and strong acidic conditions. The samples, constituted by anatase nanocrystals but, mainly, by amorphous titania, are studied by H-1-MAS NMR, FT-IR and HRTEM. The results indicate that hydrated excess proton species, generated by solvation of bridging hydroxyls protons of highly defective anatase and/or amorphous titania chains, favor the chains bonding to anatase nanoparticles and/or their condensation at the nanoparticles surface. The chains' bonding facilitates the anatase particles aggregation producing oriented self-assemblings. The preparation conditions determine a strong condensation of amorphous titania chains and it should favor anatase transformation into rutile. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Accumulation of brain iron has been suggested as a biomarker of neurodegeneration. Increased iron has been seen in the cerebral cortex in postmortem studies of neurodegenerative diseases and healthy aging. Until recently, the diminutive thickness of the cortex and its relatively low iron content have hampered in vivo study of cortical iron accumulation. Using phase images of a T2*-weighted sequence at ultrahigh field strength (7 Tesla), we examined the iron content of 22 cortical regions in 70 healthy subjects aged 22e80 years. The cortex was automatically segmented and parcellated, and phase shift was analyzed using an in-house developed method. We found a significant increase in phase shift with age in 20 of 22 cortical regions, concurrent with current understanding of cortical iron accumulation. Our findings suggest that increased cortical iron content can be assessed in healthy aging in vivo. The high spatial resolution and sensitivity to iron of our method make it a potentially useful tool for studying cortical iron accumulation in healthy aging and neurodegenerative diseases.

The adverse effects of dipyridamole and other stress agents have been evaluated. The aim of this research is to confirm the dynamic data on dipyridamole side effects during MPS. Methods: We collected data of 183 patients who underwent dipyridamole-induced stress MPS by retrospectively reviewing their clinical records, which included the severity of dipyridamole side effects in 3 min, 10 min, and 20 min after infusion. The incidence and severity at all three points, including the effect of age and gender, were obtained. Results: Adverse effects occurred in 96 patients (69.6%). The most frequent symptoms were dizziness (42.8%), chest tightness (24.6%), abdominal pain (18.1%), and headache (15.2%). Most symptoms were Grade 1 to 2, according to the grading system for common terminology criteria. The median duration of symptom persistence was 36 min, not significantly different among age and gender. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the adverse effects of dipyridamole were generally minimal and its duration was acceptable for clinical usage. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Variants in PIK3CD, which encodes the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit delta isoform, enhance membrane association and kinase activity, resulting in increased signal transduction through the PI3K-Akt pathway. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a pathogenic PIK3CD variant in a patient with history of immunologic impairment, recurrent sinopulmonary infections, and lymphoid hyperplasia presenting as intussusception. This case illustrates that while lymphoid hyperplasia secondary to immunodeficiency is most often unsurprising and non-threatening, it can present as an emergency-like intussusception.

"Analysis of data stored in a graph enables the discovery of certain information that could be hard to see if the data were stored using some other model (e.g. relational). However, the vast majority of data in information systems today is stored in relational databases, which dominate the data management field over the last decades. In spite of the rise of NoSQL technologies, the development of new information systems is still mostly based on relational databases. Given the increasing awareness about the benefits of data analysis as well as current research interest in graph mining techniques, we aim to enable the usage of those techniques on relational data. In that regard, we propose a universal relational-to-graph data conversion algorithm which can be used in preparation of data to perform a graph mining analysis. Our approach leverages the property graph model which is mainly used by the graph databases, while maintaining the level of relational data clarity.

"Although many changes have been discovered during heart maturation, the genetic mechanisms involved in the changes between immature and mature myocardium have only been partially elucidated. Here, gene expression profile changed between the human fetal and adult heart was characterized. A human microarray was applied to define the gene expression signatures of the fetal (13-17 weeks of gestation, n = 4) and adult hearts (30-40 years old, n = 4). Gene ontology analyses, pathway analyses, gene set enrichment analyses, and signal transduction network were performed to predict the function of the differentially expressed genes. Ten mRNAs were confirmed by quantificational real-time polymerase chain reaction. 5547 mRNAs were found to be significantly differentially expressed. ""Cell cycle"" was the most enriched pathway in the down-regulated genes. EFGR, IGF1R, and ITGB1 play a central role in the regulation of heart development. EGFR, IGF1R, and FGFR2 were the core genes regulating cardiac cell proliferation. The quantificational real-time polymerase chain reaction results were concordant with the microarray data. Our data identified the transcriptional regulation of heart development in the second trimester and the potential regulators that play a prominent role in the regulation of heart development and cardiac cells proliferation.

"A compact add-on model is proposed to simulate the mechanism of charge trapping and release (detrapping) and its effect on the threshold voltage of MOSFET devices. The model uses implicit algebraic differential equations compatible with transient analysis in SPICE. It also shares the accuracy level of the transient analysis. A micro model approach is used, and each trap is treated by a two-state Markov process. The normalization of trap behavior can be enabled or disabled, so that the designer can compare average trap behavior to the result of repeated Monte-Carlo simulations of a circuit. In this manner, the model can compromise between device-level modeling and circuit-level modeling. Unlike models geared towards digital circuit design, the trapping and release rates need not be constant during electrical stress. The trapping and release rates are a function of time, as they depend on the circuit state-space equations. An operational amplifier is analyzed using the new model, and the proposed approach is compared with the state of the art. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Although recent laboratory tests are showing promising progresses in the materials and production technologies of photovoltaic (PV) devices, the commercial PV modules do not show analogous impressive improvements. Therefore, a diagnostic approach, able to check the current state of health of already installed PV systems, as well as their trend of ageing, assumes a strategic importance. In this scenario, we introduce a thermography-based diagnostics able to provide a detailed, clear, and unambiguous information, thanks to a computer-aided investigation that is much deeper than the today available infrared analysis. The proposed approach allows a numerical and qualitative evaluation of each cell of the PV device. This Part I-Framework introduces the methodology, based on two main analyses. The first one (cell analysis) studies each single cell, while the second one (cluster analysis) focuses the attention on groups of PV cells. The framework is also characterized by a preprocessing in which the region of interest is extracted from the infrared image in order to focus the successive processing and analyses only on this area. The Part II-Platform and Results shows the cloud platform implementing the workflow (it automatically generates a comprehensive and detailed report), and discusses also several significant cases of study.

"A novel label-free immunosensor based on hyperbranched polyester nanoparticles with nitrite groups (HBPE-NO2), which were synthesized through a simple one-step chemical reaction, was first developed for specific detection of a-fetoprotein (AFP), the tumor marker for liver cancer. The obtained HBPE-NO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were characterized by the proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). And the fabricated process of immunosensor was investigated by attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectra (ATR-FTIR), static water contact angles, scanning electron microscope (SEM), cyclic voltammetty (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electrochemical performances of the AFP immunosensor were studied. Results indicated the prepared HBPE-NO2-modified immunosensor showed excellent electrochemical properties and satisfactory accuracy for the detection of AFP of the real clinical samples that attributed to the properties of the HBPE-NO2 NPs, which had nanosized structure to increase the specific surface area and unique chemical reactivity for loading capacity of protein molecules. Construction of biosensors using the structure and properties of hyperbranched molecules will offer ideal electrode substrates, which provided more possibilities for the design of biosensor.

"1. Invertebrates inhabiting marine and freshwater ecosystems make important contributions to global biodiversity and provide significant services that have cascading effects across ecosystems. However, this group is grossly under-represented in assessments of conservation status and often neglected in targeted aquatic conservation efforts. 2. In global assessments of 7857 freshwater invertebrates and 2864 marine invertebrates, 30-34% were considered Data Deficient highlighting the paucity of information for making such assessments. Of the invertebrate groups that could be assessed, those with poor dispersal abilities and high local endemism, such as many gastropods, crayfish and mussels, are the most threatened. 3. Springs and subterranean hydrological systems support the highest proportions of threatened freshwater species, while in marine environments coral reefs, lagoons and anchialine systems are particularly vulnerable. 4. Key agents of biodiversity decline in aquatic ecosystems are water pollution, overexploitation and harvesting, habitat degradation and destruction, alien invasive species, and climate change. Effects of dams and water management along with pollution from urban, agricultural and forestry sources are the main threats in freshwater ecosystems, whereas a broad range of factors have impacts on marine invertebrates, including biological resource use. 5. Significant impediments facing conservation of aquatic invertebrates are limited knowledge of their diversity, the need for broadscale actions to account for connectivity within and across ecosystems, lack of political will and investment, and the prospect that conditions may get worse before they improve, possibly not in time to save some already highly imperilled invertebrate species from extinction.

"A new, process-oriented approach is needed in construction management. Lean construction emphasizes the concept of flow as a way to understand production in construction, yet there is still no accepted metric for measurement of flow quality. This has hampered research and practice. The proposed construction flow index (CFI) is a composite measure that reflects the quality of production flow in repetitive construction projects. It incorporates measures of work continuity for crews, processing continuity for locations, production rate variation, amounts of work in progress, interference and operation sequence logic. Expert knowledge was acquired to establish weights for the CFI parameters, and its use was tested in evaluating the planned and actual production flows for a number of projects. Project managers can use the CFI to evaluate the quality of their construction plans and to measure and communicate production flow quality status to trade crews, enabling management and improvement of production flow. The CFI is also a valuable tool for construction research. The CFI challenges traditional construction management by measuring flow, where standard practice only measures transformation (earned value). It challenges lean construction practice using the Last Planner System, suggesting that the percent plan complete measure of plan reliability is insufficient.

"[F-18]fluorocholine PET/CT can detect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on imaging the initial steps of phosphatidylcholine synthesis. To relate the diagnostic performance of [F-18]fluorocholine positron emission tomography (PET)/x-ray computed tomography (CT) to the phospholipid composition of liver tumors, radiopathologic correspondence was performed in patients with early-stage liver cancer who had undergone [F-18]fluorocholine PET/CT before tumor resection. Tumor and adjacent liver were profiled by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, quantifying phosphatidylcholine species by mass-to-charge ratio. For clinical-radiopathologic correlation, HCC profiles were reduced to two orthogonal principal component factors (PCF1 and PCF2) accounting for 80 % of total profile variation. Tissues from 31 HCC patients and 4 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) patients were analyzed, revealing significantly higher levels of phosphocholine, CDP-choline, and highly saturated phosphatidylcholine species in HCC tumors relative to adjacent liver and ICC tumors. Significant loading values for PCF1 corresponded to phosphatidylcholines containing poly-unsaturated fatty acids while PCF2 corresponded only to highly saturated phosphatidylcholines. Only PCF2 correlated significantly with HCC tumor-to-liver [F-18]fluorocholine uptake ratio (rho = 0.59, p < 0.0005). Sensitivity for all tumors based on an abnormal [F-18]fluorocholine uptake ratio was 93 % while sensitivity for HCC based on increased tumor [F-18]fluorocholine uptake was 84 %, with lower levels of highly saturated phosphatidylcholines in tumors showing low [F-18]fluorocholine uptake. Most HCC tumors contain high levels of saturated phosphatidylcholines, supporting their dependence on de novo fatty acid metabolism for phospholipid membrane synthesis. While [F-18]fluorocholine PET/CT can serve to identify these lipogenic tumors, its imperfect diagnostic sensitivity implies metabolic heterogeneity across HCC and a weaker lipogenic phenotype in some tumors.

"A bio-electrochemical strategy was developed for constructing a simple and sensitive levofloxacin (LEV) sensor based on a single chamber microbial fuel cell (SC-MFC) using FePO4 nanoparticles (NPs) as the cathode catalyst instead of traditional Pt/C. In this assembled sensor device, FePO4 NPs dramatically promoted the electrooxidation of oxygen on the cathode, which helps to accelerate the voltage output from SC-MFC and can provide a powerful guarantee for LEV detection. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to fully characterize the FePO4 NPs. Under the optimized COD condition (3 mM), the LEV with a concentration range of 0.1-1000 pg/L could be detected successfully, and exhibited the excellent linear interval in the concentration range of 0.1-100 pg/L. During this range of concentrations of LEV, a temporary effect on the anode of exoelectrogenic bacterial in less than 10 min could occur, and then came back to the normal. It exhibited a long-term stability, maintaining the stable electricity production for 14 months of continuous running. Besides, the detection mechanism was investigated by quantum chemical calculation using density functional theory (DFT).

"Accurate measurement of cardiomyocyte contraction is a critical issue for scientists working on cardiac physiology and physiopathology of diseases implying contraction impairment. Cardiomyocytes contraction can be quantified by measuring sarcomere length, but few tools are available for this, and none is freely distributed. We developed a plug-in (SarcOptiM) for the ImageJ/Fiji image analysis platform developed by the National Institutes of Health. SarcOptiM computes sarcomere length via fast Fourier transform analysis of video frames captured or displayed in ImageJ and thus is not tied to a dedicated video camera. It can work in real time or offline, the latter overcoming rotating motion or displacement-related artifacts. SarcOptiM includes a simulator and video generator of cardiomyocyte contraction. Acquisition parameters, such as pixel size and camera frame rate, were tested with both experimental recordings of rat ventricular cardiomyocytes and synthetic videos. It is freely distributed, and its source code is available. It works under Windows, Mac, or Linux operating systems. The camera speed is the limiting factor, since the algorithm can compute online sarcomere shortening at frame rates >10 kHz. In conclusion, SarcOptiM is a free and validated user-friendly tool for studying cardiomyocyte contraction in all species, including human.

"1. INTRODUCTION The emergence of environmental problems as major social issues throughout the world has prompted sustainable development efforts in a wide range of areas, including industry, construction, and transportation, followed by the execution of numerous studies and policies. The concept of sustainable development has been dealt with in earnest in the construction field since the Declaration of Interdependence for a Sustainable Future at the 18th Chicago Convention of UIA in 1993. This Declaration included tasks to be implemented with respect to green buildings, such as the recycling of resources, application of energy-efficient designs, and utilization of natural energy in addition to the application of sustainable designs. As part of green building practices, countries around the world have been implementing various green building certification standards, such as LEED, GBCC, CASBEE, and BREEAM. These certification standards prescribe the criteria relating to the external environment, energy conservation, materials and resources, and the indoor environment, with energy conservation being the top priority for each of these issues. This is due to energy consumption in building operation accounting for more than half of the building life cycle cost. Accordingly, although many studies are undertaken for the purpose of developing the means for conserving energy in relation to green buildings, the majority of these studies are concentrated on the development of technologies for environmental facilities through the application of active designs. study the finite nature, propose hypotheses, and gather their evidence. And, to date, there is little to suggest that copying nature purports any advantages to architects, primarily because fully autonomous buildings or towns have yet to be built. According to the described Malthusian-Darwinian dynamic, the two critical questions that we seek to address in this paper are: i) What is the essence of a sustainable dwelling? and ii) What principles should be adhered to in making a dwelling sustainable? In other words, this study aims to elucidate the essence of sustainability in green building design implementation.

METHODS Google (TM), Bing (TM), and Yahoo (TM) search engines were searched independently by three researchers in December 2014. Only English-language websites were selected on the basis of predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Researchers independently evaluated the quality of each website by using the DISCERN and the HONcode instruments. The readability levels were calculated using two formulas; the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Index, and the Coleman-Liau Readability Index. The agreement between the evaluators was calculated using Cohen kappa coefficient. RESULTS eighty-four websites were finally identified. Scores varied from a minimum DISCERN score of 18 to a maximum of 68 [mean +/- SD, 42.2 +/- 10.7; median = 41.5, interquartile range, interquartile range (IQR) = 15.8] and a minimum score of HONcode of 0.14 and a maximum of 0.95 (mean +/- SD, 0.16 +/- 0.19; median = 0.45, IQR = 0.29). Most of these websites were reviewed in 2014 and 2015 (n = 51). The creators of these websites were: universities and research centers (n = 25, 30%), foundations and associations (n = 15, 18%), commercial and pharmaceutical companies (n = 25, 30%), charities and volunteer work (n = 9, 10%), and non-university educational bodies (n = 10, 12%).

"Although a concrete-filled steel tube (CFT) column, which is one of the composite columns frequently used in building construction because of its structural performance, economic feasibility, and good space utilization, has a high potential to reduce CO2 emissions because of combining two heterogeneous materials, the relationship among CO2 emissions, cost, and structural parameters in green construction of buildings with CFT columns was not yet carried out. In this study, an optimum design model was proposed to analyze the relationship. Based on the analysis, it was founded that CFT with circular sections were more effective than square type in terms of CO2 emissions and cost by 57.03% and 11.18%, respectively, while square type was advantageous in aspect of space utilization than the circular section by 9.73%. Also, with the consideration of various strengths of materials, CO2 emissions, cost, and space utilization for the columns can be reduced by 24.38%, 29.66%, and 21.08%, respectively. In addition, the proposed model was applied to construction of a 35-story real building. From the analysis of optimum designs for the building, the circular section was more advantageous than square section regarding the CO2 emission and material cost by 2.47% and 8.57%, respectively, while square section occupied smaller space than circular section by 17.95%. It is concluded that CO2 emission, cost, and space utilization of the column in the real building can be reduced by 21.05%, 14.97%, and 20.18%, respectively, with the optimum section type and material strength.

"Among alternative scheduling techniques in construction management are linear and repetitive scheduling and line of balance (LOB). They are uniquely different from the dominant network-based technique because they have been developed for projects with repetitive units of work and crew operations. Notably, they feature quantitative measures of both work and time, which no network-based approach offers. However, a study of their origins - for example, the US Navy - reveals that their original use and capabilities deviate from current application, which is limited at best. Indeed, currently, the name-giving LOB is itself omitted. Therefore, this research has the goal to explore these scheduling techniques in detail. Its objectives are to delineate their modelling elements as described by original sources in a structured manner, to compare them in detail and identify any changes over time and to comment on implications for practical use and extract unsolved research questions. Its methodology follows a comparative research approach. Differences are found in how productivity and cyclic crew deployment are expressed, besides the glaring omission of the LOB itself in the construction use of this method. It is found that, historically, LOB was intended for manufacturing, but when introduced to construction, important characteristics of the production plan and progress chart became forgotten. In parallel, linear scheduling was developed for construction, whose similarities to LOB may have added confusion. Clarifying the complete methods by explicitly outlining their analytical capabilities will improve understanding to allow project managers to benefit from these powerful tools. It also enables future research to model LOB with singularity functions to yield a unified formulation of these alternative scheduling techniques.

"A high level of concern is placed on the storage, handling, transportation, and distribution of vaccines and other pharmaceutical products, particularly those that are time and temperature sensitive. While active and passive cooling equipment and monitoring devices are important, it is the various personnel responsible for executing and writing procedures, designing and operating systems, and investigating problems and helping prevent them who are paramount in establishing and maintaining a ""cold.chain"" for time and temperature sensitive pharmaceutical products (TTSPPs). These professionals must possess the required competencies, knowledge, skills and abilities so they can effectively perform these activities with appropriate levels of expertise. These are complex tasks that require the development of higher cognitive skills that cannot be adequately addressed through professional development opportunities based on simple information delivery and content acquisition. This paper describes two unique learning solutions (one on a bus called the ""wheels course"" and the other online called ""e-learning"") that have been developed by WHO Global Learning Opportunities (WHO/GLO) to provide participants with opportunities not just to learn about cold chain systems or vaccine management, but, rather, to develop high levels of expertise in their respective fields through experiential and authentic learning activities. In these interactive learning environments, participants have opportunities to address real-life situations in contexts similar to what they may face in their own work environments and develop solutions and critical thinking skills they can apply when they return to their jobs. This paper further delineates the managerial and operational vaccine management functions encompassed in these two unique learning environments. The paper also describes the alignment of the objectives addressed in the ""wheels course"" and the e-learning version with effective vaccine management (EVM) criteria as prescribed by WHO. The paper concludes with an example of a real world product developed by course graduates (specifically a decision tree that is now used by some national programmes). These types of products, valuable in their own right, often emerge when learning environments based on authentic learning principles are designed and implemented as they were by WHO/GLO.

"Apple leaf disease is one of the main factors to constrain the apple production and quality. It takes a long time to detect the diseases by using the traditional diagnostic approach, thus farmers often miss the best time to prevent and treat the diseases. Apple leaf disease recognition based on leaf image is an essential research topic in the field of computer vision, where the key task is to find an effective way to represent the diseased leaf images. In this research, based on image processing techniques and pattern recognition methods, an apple leaf disease recognition method was proposed. A color transformation structure for the input RGB( Red, Green and Blue) image was designed firstly and then RGB model was converted to HSI( Hue, Saturation and Intensity), YUV and gray models. The background was removed based on a specific threshold value, and then the disease spot image was segmented with region growing algorithm( RGA). Thirty-eight classifying features of color, texture and shape were extracted from each spot image. To reduce the dimensionality of the feature space and improve the accuracy of the apple leaf disease identification, the most valuable features were selected by combining genetic algorithm( GA) and correlation based feature selection( CFS). Finally, the diseases were recognized by SVM classifier. In the proposed method, the selected feature subset was globally optimum. The experimental results of more than 90% correct identification rate on the apple diseased leaf image database which contains 90 disease images for there kinds of apple leaf diseases, powdery mildew, mosaic and rust, demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible and effective.

"A method of chemistry tabulation combined with presumed probability density function (PDF) is applied to simulate piloted premixed jet burner flames with high Karlovitz number using large eddy simulation. Thermo-chemistry states are tabulated by the combination of auto-ignition and extended auto-ignition model. To evaluate the predictive capability of the proposed tabulation method to represent the thermo-chemistry states under the condition of different fresh gases temperature, a-priori study is conducted by performing idealised transient one-dimensional premixed flame simulations. Presumed PDF is used to involve the interaction of turbulence and flame with beta PDF to model the reaction progress variable distribution. Two presumed PDF models, Dirichlet distribution and independent beta distribution, respectively, are applied for representing the interaction between two mixture fractions that are associated with three inlet streams. Comparisons of statistical results show that two presumed PDF models for the two mixture fractions are both capable of predicting temperature and major species profiles, however, they are shown to have a significant effect on the predictions for intermediate species. An analysis of the thermo-chemical state-space representation of the sub-grid scale (SGS) combustion model is performed by comparing correlations between the carbon monoxide mass fraction and temperature. The SGS combustion model based on the proposed chemistry tabulation can reasonably capture the peak value and change trend of intermediate species. Aspects regarding model extensions to adequately predict the peak location of intermediate species are discussed.

Max NAE-SAT turns into Max NAE-k-SAT if each clause contains just k literals. Max NAE-k-SAT for k = 2, 3 and 4 can be approximated to 1.139 (1/0.878), 1.10047 (1/0.9087) and 8/7 respectively.

"Access control is critical for many applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) since the owner of an IoT device (and application) may only permit one user to access a subset of the resources of the device. To provide access control for an IoT network, recent work adopted the capability-based access control (CBAC) model, which allows an IoT device to decide on the authorization by itself based on a capability token. However, the existing approaches based on CBAC directly attach the capability token at the end of CoAP when sending a request message. For the receiver, it is not easy to retrieve the capability token from the request message if the CoAP payload is present, because CoAP does not have a length field to indicate the size of its payload. To counter this problem, we propose a CoAP option, Cap-Token, to encapsulate a capability token when sending request messages. Because a CoAP option is independent from other CoAP fields, a receiver can get the capability token from the Cap-Token option of the request message without ambiguity. We also provide a compression mechanism to reduce the size of the Cap- Token option. Our evaluation shows that the compression mechanism can save the size of the option by 60%. Adding a compressed Cap-Token option to a request message increases the IP datagram size by 45 bytes, which is only 41% of the increase when directly attaching the capability token at the end of CoAP.

"85% of a construction worker's work-day is spent on the construction site. This means that a large part of a worker's health and wellbeing could depend on the construction site and its environs. Construction work, which is inherently stressful due to the ever present threat of fatalities and injuries, compromises the ergonomic reality and human sustenance on construction sites. This necessitates the need to create a beneficial and comfortable environment that is motivational, inspirational, and healing. The biophilic construction site model (BCSM) which involves methodology of 'greening construction sites', is proposed as a healthy means of tapping into the natural resources of the construction site environment. It is intended to create a comfort zone on the construction site that would generate a symbiotic benefit to enhance its humanistic value and engender the health and wellbeing and creative performance of workers. The paper reports on a case study in the form of a focus group study and a comparative analysis of two similar construction sites in the Northern Cape region of South Africa. The findings present the healthy inter-nurture existing between a living construction site and its human occupants as a cost effective psychotherapeutic intervention in sustainable sites initiative and ergonomics, which according to research findings is as of yet missing in the construction management body of knowledge (CMBOK). The paper conclusively recommends the 'greening of construction sites'; specifically the inclusion of plants within site offices, welfare facilities and worksite premises; as a relevant means of harnessing nature's healing and rejuvenating essence towards a more productive goal in construction.

"A premature infant needs a stable thermal environment. This paper studies if the infant weight can be employed in the standard heat regulation system in incubators. This was done in two stages. First, a weight sensor was designed by means of using strain gauge in order to provide weight measurement. Later, a heat regulation circuit was designed and implemented by means of using a microcontroller. The humidity, environmental and skin temperature, and infant's weight are measured and used as inputs. The experiments showed that infant's weight can be successfully added to the control circuit in the incubator instrument. The results showed that infant's weight can productively contribute in temperature control with good confidence. The average standard error was equal to 0.48 degrees C. The results reveal that the infant's weight can contribute to increase quality assurance of incubators.

"Accessible summary What is known on the subject? The concept of compassion is well documented in the healthcare literature but has received limited attention in mental health nursing. What this paper adds to existing knowledge? Mental health nurses struggle with defining compassion. The study, with its limitations, brings greater clarity to the meaning of compassion for community mental health nurses and NHS organizations. Mental health nurses need time to reflect on their provision of compassionate care. What are the implications for practice? The study has shown that compassion is important for NHS healthcare management, frontline mental health nurses and policy-makers in UK, and there is potential for sharing practice and vision across NHS organisations. Mental health nurses could benefit from training to facilitate their understanding of compassionate practices. Emphasis should be placed on the importance of self-compassion and how this can be nurtured from the secure base of clinical supervision. Abstract Introduction There is increasing emphasis in policy, research and practice in the UK and internationally on the importance of caring in health care. Compassion needs to be at the core of all healthcare professionals' practice. Recently, health care has received negative attention through media and government reports which cite a lack of compassion in care. Rationale The concept of compassion has received limited attention in community mental health nursing. Aim Based on data taken from semi-structured interviews with community mental health nurses, this paper aims to describe interpretations and perspectives of compassion to gain insight and development of its meaning. Method A naturalistic, interpretive approach was taken to the study. Semi-structured interviews with nine mental health nurses were analysed using Burnard's 14-step model of thematic analysis. Findings The research illuminates the complexity of compassion and how its practice impacts on emotional responses and relationships with self, patients, colleagues and the employing organization. Participants identified difficulties engaging with compassionate practice whilst recognizing it as a driving force underpinning provision of care. Implications for practice Mental health nurses need to be supported to work towards a greater understanding of compassionate care for clinical practice and the need for self-compassion.

"Agent-based modelling and simulation is a promising methodology that can be applied in the study of population dynamics. The main advantage of this technique is that it allows representing the particularities of the individuals that are modeled along with the interactions that take place among them and their environment. Hence, classical numerical simulation approaches are less adequate for reproducing complex dynamics. Nowadays, there is a rise of interest on using distributed computing to perform large-scale simulation of social systems. However, the inherent complexity of this type of applications is challenging and requires the study of possible solutions from the parallel computing perspective (e.g., how to deal with fine grain or irregular workload). In this paper, we discuss the particularities of simulating populating dynamics by using parallel discrete event simulation methodologies. To illustrate our approach, we present a possible solution to make transparent the use of parallel simulation for modeling demographic systems: Yades tool. In Yades, modelers can easily define models that describe different demographic processes with a web user interface and transparently run them on any computer architecture environment thanks to its demographic simulation library and code generator. Therefore, transparency is provided by two means: the provision of a web user interface where modelers and policy makers can specify their agent-based models with the tools they are familiar with, and the automatic generation of the simulation code that can be executed in any platform (cluster or supercomputer). A study is conducted to evaluate the performance of our solution in a High Performance Computing environment. The main benefit of this outline is that our findings can be generalized to problems with similar characteristics to our demographic simulation model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Aging buildings represent a significant percentage of existing buildings and are often in urgent need of upgrading to improve their operational, economic, and environmental performance. The owners of these buildings often seek to identify and implement building upgrade measures that are capable of improving building sustainability as well as achieving certification under various green building rating systems such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). In order to support decision-makers in promoting building sustainability and achieving LEED certification for existing building, this paper presents the development of a novel optimization model that is capable of minimizing the required upgrade cost of achieving a desired LEED certification level such as Silver or Gold. The model is designed to identify cost-effective building measures, plans, and/or performance to achieve a specified LEED certification for existing buildings while keeping required upgrade cost to a minimum. The optimization model is implemented using a genetic algorithm (GA) due to its capabilities of identifying optimal solutions for this type of problem in a reasonable computational time, and efficiently and accurately modeling this specific optimization problem with the least number of decision variables and constraints. A project case study of a rest-area building is used to illustrate the optimization model and to demonstrate its novel and unique capabilities. The primary contribution this research makes to the body of knowledge is its new methodology for optimizing the selection of building upgrade measures to achieve LEED certification for existing building with minimum upgrade cost.

"A new fatigue reliability assessment function which takes into account the vehicle and temperature loadings has been developed in this study. The vehicle and temperature loadings are important parameters as they can cause fatigue failure of the welds in a steel box girder. The temperature affects the traffic loading effect by changing the elastic modulus of asphalt pavement. The effect of the temperature difference has been considered based on the measured data and the finite element analysis. Linear regression equations between the equivalent stress and the temperature for different vehicle types have been developed. Using the thermal stress analysis and the rain-flow counting method, the temperature difference fatigue stress spectrum has been determined. Further, a limit equation for the fatigue reliability assessment, which takes into account both the vehicle and temperature loadings, has been developed. Finally, the effects of the temperature and the traffic growth rate on the fatigue reliability of two welding types of Nan-xi Yangtze River Suspension Bridge have been assessed.

In the context of youth obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and anxiety, accommodation may contribute to the development and maintenance of the disorder. We review the theory and research literature on accommodation, including measures of accommodation. Findings support the idea that accommodation is not a preferred parenting strategy; the sequelae of accommodation are negative and are often associated with both parent and sibling distress. Accommodation should be assessed and targeted in treatment for youth OCD and anxiety. We conclude by identifying several areas for future research, including the development of interventions that specifically target accommodation, the evaluation of potential family factors implicated in accommodation, and the exploration of the construct of accommodation in other childhood disorders.

"A new directional solidification technique has been presented. This technique employs the pyrolytic graphite for heat dissipation by conduction and does not withdraw the cast. The furnace design was presented for this static solid cooling (SSC) method. A heat dissipation model was put forward for evaluating the cooling efficiency by calculating the total thermal resistance in directional solidification. The total thermal resistance in the SSC method is the minimum compared with other methods. The solidification process is simulated and the results show that the axial temperature gradient increases to 130 degrees C/cm from 52 degrees C/cm (Bridgman method) and the growth rate is improved to 10.84 mm/min from 3.86 mm/min (Bridgman method). The solidification time is reduced by 64.4%. The cooling rate increases dramatically as well. Additionally, the heat insulation of the hot and cool zones is improved substantially in the SSC method. The thermal resistance of the mould is reduced as well due to the thin mould. Besides, the SSC method employs the electrical network to control the growth rate. The solidification condition is much uniform due to the position control by the electrical network. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Ambient Intelligence is a new paradigm in information technology to empower people. Such a paradigm that highlights human interaction with machines makes smart technologies a good candidate for development of various real-life solutions in the field of health care, including human activity recognition in smart homes. Since the description of user activity plays an important role in a smart environment, recognition and tracking user activities of daily living can provide unprecedented opportunities for health monitoring, applications, and assistive life utilities, particularly for the elderly, disabled, and people with dementia or Alzheimer disease. Due to sensor data nature with different sampling rates and complex correlations, significant challenges arise due to storage, presentation, exchange and manipulate of this data category. One rational solution to solve such challenges is to use techniques which are based on Semantic Web and Ontology. Recently there have been large varieties of proposed approaches in which they use such techniques. The vast amount of human activity recognition in smart home while using Ontological approaches has made it difficult to make adequate comparisons and accurate assessment. This article presents a framework for analyzing each of the approaches proposed in this regard.

The number and incidences of injuries as well as injuries leading to permanent medical impairment (PMI) were calculated during 2008-2011. Each year approximately 12000 injuries and 1162660 licensed athletes were eligible for analysis. Eighty-five percent of the injuries were reported in football, ice hockey, floorball, and handball. The highest injury incidence as well as PMI was in motorcycle, handball, skating, and ice hockey. Females had higher risk of a PMI compared with males in automobile sport, handball, floorball, and football.

However, frameworks such as RePast are designed to execute serially on central processing units and therefore cannot efficiently handle large model sizes. In this paper, we report on our implementation of the BIS using FLAME GPU, a parallel computing ABM simulator designed to execute on graphics processing units. To benchmark our implementation, we simulate the response of the immune system to a viral infection of generic tissue cells.

We observe that our implementation has a 13x performance advantage over the original RePast implementation.

"A broadband broad-angle radar cross-sectional (RCS) reduction measure applicable to planar surfaces is proposed. This novel structure contains several layers of randomly displaced metal patches and layers are spaced by a quarter wavelength. Specular reflection at normal incidence is suppressed by the phase cancellation technique. The reduction bandwidth is broadened by setting the layer surface area ratio based on binomial coefficients. Because the structure contains no absorbent material, metal surfaces are divided into small patches and displaced randomly to avoid reflection peaks beyond the boresight direction. The RCS reduction effect is validated via measurements in a far-field antenna range. Parametric studies and detailed discussions about this technique are conducted using simulation results computed from full-wave numerical tools, which include not only the specular reflection but also contributions from higher order scattering mechanisms. The proposed structure can be applied on planar target surfaces and has the potential to incorporate lossy dielectric loadings to reduce the structure thickness and suppress scatterings.

Species and individual identification are performed outside the R environment, either via tags assigned in dedicated image management software or by moving images into species directories. 4. Input for occupancy and (spatial) capture-recapture analyses for density and abundance estimation, for example in the R packages unmarked or secr, is computed in a flexible and reproducible manner. In addition, survey summary reports can be generated, spatial distributions of records can be plotted and exported to GIS software, and single-and two-species activity patterns can be visualized. 5. camtrapR allows for streamlined and flexible camera trap data management and should be most useful to researchers and practitioners who regularly handle large amounts of camera trapping data.

"Along with the progress in computer hardware architecture and computational power, in order to overcome technological bottlenecks, software applications that make use of expert and intelligent systems must race against time where nanoseconds matter in the long-awaited future. This is possible with the integration of excellent solvers to software engineering methodologies that provide optimization-based decision support for planning. Since the logistics market is growing rapidly, the optimization of routing systems is of primary concern that motivates the use of vehicle routing problem (VRP) solvers as software components integrated as an optimization engine. A critical success factor of routing optimization is quality vs. response time performance. Less time-consuming and more efficient automated processes can be achieved by employing stronger solution algorithms. This study aims to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery (VRPSPD) which is a popular extension of the basic Vehicle Routing Problem arising in real world applications where pickup and delivery operations are simultaneously taken into account to satisfy the vehicle capacity constraint with the objective of total travelled distance minimization. Since the problem is known to be NP-hard, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm based on an ant colony system (ACS) and a variable neighborhood search (VNS) is developed for its solution. VNS is a powerful optimization algorithm that provides intensive local search. However, it lacks a memory structure. This weakness can be minimized by utilizing long term memory structure of ACS and hence the overall performance of the algorithm can be boosted. In the proposed algorithm, instead of ants, VNS releases pheromones on the edges while ants provide a perturbation mechanism for the integrated algorithm using the pheromone information in order to explore search space further and jump from local optima. The performance of the proposed ACS empowered VNS algorithm is studied on well-known benchmarks test problems taken from the open literature of VRPSPD for comparison purposes. Numerical results confirm that the developed approach is robust and very efficient in terms of both solution quality and CPU time since better results provided in a shorter time on benchmark data sets is a good performance indicator.

"A Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR) is a highly complex and unstable system. Designing a safe, reliable and robust controller with good performance for such a large and complex system is an important control engineering problem. In this work, a Decentralized Fuzzy Logic Controller (DFLC) with 140 input and 70 output membership functions, is designed for a 70th order Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) type PHWR. In order to obtain high performance of the controller, it needs to be tuned optimally, however, it is very challenging task to optimally tune the DFLC with such a large membership functions. Moreover, PHWR is a coupled system which imposes additional limitation in tuning the controller since the output of one PHWR's zone affects the outputs of other zones. In this work, an application of Nelder-Mead Algorithm (NMA) is presented for auto tuning the DFLC. The NMA performance depends upon objective function and initial points given to the NMA at the start of the tuning process. A novel method for selecting the optimal objective function and initial points for the NMA is also proposed since their selection is another complicated process. Although several objective functions have been proposed by the researchers for use with NMA, this work focuses five common indices (IAE, ISE, ITAE, ITSE and ISTE) as objective functions, which are simple and system independent. Finally, the optimally tuned high-performance DFLC is applied to the PHWR and evaluated by simulating different scenarios.

Sub-space modeling based geometric programming power optimization has been successfully applied to three different op-amps in 0.18 mu m technology. HSPICE simulation results show that sub-space modeling based GP optimization can allow efficient and accurate analog design. Computational effort can be managed to an acceptable level when searching sub-spaces for transistors by using practical constraints.

A new minimal path algorithm is proposed and applied to SBI minimising a cost function to select the best path corresponding to the edges of the target object. The cost function is calculated based on all possible paths from each pixel to the beginning of the image while lowering the computational complexity. Comparing with previous methods, the proposed method removes artefacts and provides clearer and smoother edges even when the prior shape is far from the target object.

A recent survey of surgical practice in this condition showed variation in management approaches. As a result we set out to devise recommendations for practice for UK colorectal surgeons. Method Results from a national survey were used to devise a set of potential consensus statements. Consultant colorectal surgeons were invited to participate in the exercise via the previous survey and the mailing list of the professional society. Iterative voting was performed on each statement using a five-point Likert scale and electronic voting, with opportunity for discussion and refinement between each vote. Consensus was defined as >80% agreement. Results Seventeen surgeons and two patient representatives voted upon 51 statements. Consensus was achieved on 39 items. Participants advocated a patientcentred approach by a colorectal specialist, within strong multidisciplinary teamworking. The use of anti-TNF alpha therapy is advocated. Where definitive surgical techniques are considered they should be carefully selected to avoid adverse impact on function. Ano/rectovaginal fistulas should be managed by specialists in fistulating disease. Stoma or proctectomy could be discussed earlier in a patient's treatment pathway to improve choice, as they may improve quality of life.

"According to consciousness involvement, human's learning can be roughly classified into explicit learning and implicit learning. Contrasting strongly to explicit learning with clear targets and rules, such as our school study of mathematics, learning is implicit when we acquire new information without intending to do so. Research from psychology indicates that implicit learning is ubiquitous in our daily life. Moreover, implicit learning plays an important role in human visual perception. But in the past 60 years, most of the well-known machine-learning models aimed to simulate explicit learning while the work of modeling implicit learning was relatively limited, especially for computer vision applications. This article proposes a novel unsupervised computational model for implicit visual learning by exploring dissipative system, which provides a unifying macroscopic theory to connect biology with physics. We test the proposed Dissipative Implicit Learning Model (DILM) on various datasets.

"Activation of the canonical wingless-related integration site (Wnt)/beta-catenin signaling pathway is associated with malignant transformation, development of fibrosis, and angiogenesis. We analyzed beta-catenin mRNA expression in bone marrow of 29 patients with primary (PMF), 4 with secondary (SMF) myelofibrosis, and 16 control participants using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT PCR). beta-Catenin expression is increased in PMF and SMF and might potentiate anemia. Introduction: beta-Catenin is a central effector molecule of the canonical wingless-related integration site (Wnt) signaling pathway. It is important for maintenance of stem cell homeostasis and its aberrant activation has been implicated in a wide array of malignant hematological disorders. There are few reports suggesting its dysregulation in Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Patients and Methods: We analyzed beta-catenin mRNA expression in bone marrow (BM) aspirates of 29 patients with primary (PMF) and 4 patients with secondary, post Ph- MPN, myelofibrosis (SMF) using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT PCR). The control group consisted of 16 BM aspirates from patients with limited-stage aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma without BM involvement. We compared relative gene expression with clinical and hematological parameters. Results: Relative expression of A-catenin differed significantly among groups (P = .0002), it was significantly higher in patients with PMF and SMF than in the control group, but did not differ between patients with PMF and SMF. A negative correlation was found regarding hemoglobin level in PMF (P = .017). No association according to Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutational status or JAK2 V617F allele burden was detected. Conclusion: Our results show for the first time that beta-catenin mRNA expression is increased in patients with PMF and SMF and its upregulation might potentiate anemia. A number of inflammatory cytokines associated with PMF are capable of mediating their effects through increased beta-catenin expression. Accordingly, beta-catenin can induce expression of a number of genes implicated in processes of cell cycle control, fibrosis, and angiogenesis, which are central to the PMF pathogenesis. Therefore, beta-catenin might represent an interesting new therapeutic target in these diseases.

"A complementation operation on a vertex of a digraph changes all outgoing arcs into non-arcs, and outgoing non-arcs into arcs. Given a digraph G, a partially complemented digraph (G) over tilde is a digraph obtained from G by performing a sequence of vertex complement operations on G. Dahlhaus et al. showed that, given an adjacency-list representation of (G) over tilde, depth-first search (DFS) on G can be performed in O(n + (m) over tilde) time, where (m) over tilde is the number of vertices and ill is the number of edges in (G) over tilde. This can be used for finding a depth-first spanning forest and the strongly connected components of the complement of G in time that is linear in the size of G, and Dahlhaus et al. give applications to finding the modular decomposition of an undirected graph that require that some adjacency lists be complemented and others not. To achieve this bound, their algorithm makes use of a somewhat complicated stack-like data structure to simulate the recursion stack, instead of implementing it directly as a recursive algorithm.

This study considers the application of a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology that can be applied to assess the sustainable development of transport infrastructure projects, taking into account a range of transport, social, financial and environmental criteria. Furthermore, in order to resolve the strategic decision making under resource constraints and the carbon footprint factor, a zero-one goal programming (ZOGP) model is developed to facilitate an optimal portfolio of sustainable public transport infrastructure projects in Taiwan.

"Academic research and technological innovation associated with rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems in the UK has seen a shift of emphasis in recent years. Traditional design approaches use whole life cost assessments that prioritise financial savings associated with the provision of an alternative water supply. However, researchers and practitioners are increasingly recognising broader benefits associated with rainwater reuse, such as stormwater attenuation benefits. This paper identifies and describes a set of novel RWH system configurations that have potential for deployment in UK houses. Conceptual schematics are provided to define these innovations alongside traditional configurations. Discussion of the drivers supporting these configurations illustrates the opportunities for RWH deployment in a wide range of settings. A quantitative multi criteria analysis was used to evaluate and score the configurations under a range of emerging criteria. The work identifies several RWH system configurations that can outperform traditional ones in terms of specified cost and benefits. Selection of a specific RWH technology is shown to be highly dependent on user priorities. It is proposed that the system configurations highlighted could enable RWH to be cost-effectively installed in a broad set of contexts that have experienced minimal exploitation to date.

The structure and component of smart sensing material was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), respectively. These results illustrated the smart sensing material was prepared successfully. The recognition characterizations of smart sensing material were evaluated, and results showed that the fluorescence intensity of smart sensing material was reduced gradually, as the concentration of protein increased, and the smart sensing material showed selective recognition for HRP among other proteins. Furthermore, the recognition ability of the smart sensing material for glycoprotein was regulated by controlling the pH value and temperature. Therefore, this strategy opens up new way to construct smart material for detection of glycoprotein. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"A new gain enhancement technique for an operational amplifier (opamp) using a replica amplifier is presented to reduce a sensitivity of a gain mismatch between the main amplifier and the replica amplifier which limits a gain-enhancement factor in the conventional replica-amp techniques. In the proposed technique, the replica amplifier is used to only amplify an error voltage of the main amplifier. The outputs of the main amplifier and the replica amplifier are added to cancel the error voltage of the main amplifier. The proposed technique can also achieve a higher output voltage swing because the replica amplifier amplifies only the error voltage. In case of using a fully-differential common-source opamp for the main amplifier and a telescopic opamp for the replica amplifier, Monte Carlo simulation at 100 iterations shows that the proposed amplifier has almost the same gain variation with 15.5 dB gain enhancement and about five times output voltage swing expanding for a supply voltage of 1.2V compared with the single closed-loop amplifier using the telescopic opamp.

"Among the many scientific advances to come from the study of nanoscience, the development of ligand-targeted nanoparticles to eliminate solid tumors is predicted to have a major impact on human health. There are many reports describing novel designs and testing of targeted nanoparticles to treat cancer. While the principles of the technology are well demonstrated in controlled lab experiments, there are still many hurdles to overcome for the science to mature into truly efficacious targeted nanoparticles that join the arsenal of agents currently used to treat cancer in humans. One of these hurdles is overcoming unwanted biodistribution to the liver while maximizing delivery to the tumor. This almost certainly requires advances in both nanoparticle stealth technology and targeting. Currently, it continues to be a challenge to control the loading of ligands onto polyethylene glycol (PEG) to achieve maximal targeting. Nanoparticle cellular uptake and subcellular targeting of genes and siRNA also remain a challenge. This review examines the types of ligands that have been most often used to target nanoparticles to solid tumors. As the science matures over the coming decade, careful control over ligand presentation on nanoparticles of precise size, shape, and charge will likely play a major role in achieving success.

"A novel pursuit-based approach is presented to investigate collective motions and formations of a large number of agents with both single-integrator kinematics and double-integrator dynamics on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Each agent pursues its neighbors according to a directed acyclic graph, in which the agents without neighbors are leaders. Based on signal flow graph analysis and Mason's rule, necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for BIBO stability of resulting pursuit systems. Moreover, achievable collective motions and formations are analyzed by adjusting a set of control parameters when leaders keep stationary, perform uniform rectilinear motions, and perform uniform circular motions. Finally, simulations are provided for achieving a static formation and mimicking several complex collective behaviors observed in nature, such as V-formation, vortex motions, and tornado motions.

"A novel closed-loop process is demonstrated to control deposition microstructure during laser additive manufacturing (LAM) in real-time. An infrared imaging system is developed to monitor surface temperatures during the process as feedback signals. Cooling rates and melt pool temperatures are recorded in real-time to provide adequate information regarding thermal gradients, and thus control the deposition microstructure affected by cooling rates during LAM. Using correlations between the cooling rate, traveling speed, and the clad microstructure, a novel feedback PID controller is established to control the cooling rate. The controller is designed to maintain the cooling rate around a desired point by tuning the traveling speed. The performance of the controller is examined on several single-track and multi-track closed-loop claddings in order to achieve desired microstructures with specific properties. Results indicate that the closed-loop controller is capable of generating a consistent controlled microstructure during the LAM process in real-time.

"A remotely-piloted aircraft (RPA) is used in this study to collect high resolution data of the flow in complex terrain at a potential site for a wind energy test field in Southern Germany. It is described how such a system was used to retrieve information about the flow field, turbulence intensity, vertical wind components and shear at an escarpment site that is known for its high wind potential. Measurements were done with the aircraft on several days with varying wind and weather conditions, while the focus of the study is on the characterisation of the flow field in main wind direction and neutral stratification. It is shown that flow inclination of up to 30 is found over the escarpment, but attenuates within a few hundred metres downstream. The formation of a reattached boundary layer could be measured, as well as an increased turbulence intensity in the reattachment zone. The results are highly valuable information for the planning of a wind energy test site at the location of the experiment and can also be used for the validation of numerical simulations and remote sensing instruments.

The device provides better current measurement characteristics compared with the conventional current measurement devices such as a shunt resistor with an ammeter or the multiple shunts consisting of molybdenum having a low temperature coefficient and a Rogowski coil with an integrated circuit. The currents in several electrical circuits have been measured using the developed current-voltage transferring device (CVTD) as voltages between the aluminum and copper elements. The measured voltages (V-m) are proportional to measuring currents (I-m), which is shown as the following the experimental equation V-m [mV] =kI(m) [A], in which k is a coefficient depending on the configuration of the CVTD.

"A test cover comprised of three different needle-punched geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) products and covered with up to 1 m of cover soil (gravelly sand) was built over arsenic-rich tailings at a former gold mine in Nova Scotia, Canada, to evaluate the performance of the GCLs under local climatic conditions. Of the GCLs examined, one had untreated and two had polymer-enhanced natural sodium bentonite. The three GCLs each had different carriers: one with a woven geotextile, one with a scrim-reinforced nonwoven geotextile, and one with a woven geotextile laminated with a polypropylene film. At some locations, each type of GCL was placed in direct contact with the tailings. At other locations, each GCL was separated from the tailings by 0.15 m of cover soil. Samples of each GCL, tailings, and cover soil were recovered 1 and 2 years after construction. Tests show that the GCL with untreated bentonite maintained a low hydraulic conductivity (= 0.7 m of cover soil above the GCL even though there was significant cation exchange of the sodium in the GCL with divalent cations in the tailings-soil porewater (the mole fraction of sodium (exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP)) decreased from 65% to 10%-17%). The GCL with polymer-enhanced bentonite had a lower hydraulic conductivity (= 0.7 m of cover soil above the GCL) and experienced less cation exchange (ESP decreased to 19%-28%) than the standard GCL. The other GCL with polymer-enhanced bentonite and a carrier geotextile coated with a geofilm demonstrated the best hydraulic performance regardless of the thickness of cover soil or presence of an initially uncontaminated foundation layer. The presence of a foundation layer between the GCL and tailings impeded the migration of arsenic from the tailings into the GCLs. All GCLs were serving as an effective barrier to arsenic migration.

"Advances in artificial intelligence and computer graphics digital technologies have contributed to a relative increase in realism in virtual characters. Preserving virtual characters' communicative realism, in particular, joined the ranks of the improvements in natural language technology, and animation algorithms. This paper focuses on culturally relevant paralinguistic cues in nonverbal communication. We model the effects of an Englishspeaking digital character with different accents on human interactants (i. e., users). Our cultural influence model proposes that paralinguistic realism, in the form of accented speech, is effective in promoting culturally congruent cognition only when it is self-relevant to users. For example, a Chinese or Middle Eastern English accent may be perceived as foreign to individuals who do not share the same ethnic cultural background with members of those cultures. However, for individuals who are familiar and affiliate with those cultures (i. e., in-group members who are bicultural), accent not only serves as a motif of shared social identity, it also primes them to adopt culturally appropriate interpretive frames that influence their decision making.

"A combination of 3-D vision and X-ray radiography is proposed to enable low-cost, generally applicable online inspection of internal quality of horticultural and potentially other products. The underlying concept assumes that the shape of the product is known beforehand through a deformable shape model. A 3-D vision system is used in combination with the shape model to accurately determine the complete outer surface shape of the sample. This shape is voxelized to generate a reference product from which a X-ray radiograph is simulated to be compared with a measured radiograph, hence revealing the presence of any defects or disorders. Advantages of this method are that small deviations in internal density are detected easily since the cumulative information of the bulk object shape is removed. Furthermore, no specific detection algorithms have to be developed for different types of defects, since the method will directly identify deviations from the ideal. Validation on two datasets and comparison with two reference detections methods (classical image processing and a human operator) shows that the proposed method reliably (accuracy >99%) detect defects larger than 3.5 mm radius with densities differences between sample and defects as small as 10%. Voids are reliably (accuracy >99%) detected down to a radius of 1.5 mm, corresponding to a volume of less than 0.02 cm(3). (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

"A mechanomyogram (MMG) measured with a displacement sensor (displacement MMG) can provide a better estimation of longitudinal muscle stiffness than that measured with an acceleration sensor (acceleration MMG), but the displacement MMG cannot provide transverse muscle stiffness. We propose a method to estimate both longitudinal and transverse muscle stiffness from a velocity MMG using a system identification technique. The aims of this study are to show the advantages of the proposed method. The velocity MMG was measured using a capacitor microphone and a differential circuit, and the MMG, evoked by electrical stimulation, of the tibialis anterior muscle was measured five times in seven healthy young male volunteers. The evoked MMG system was identified using the singular value decomposition method and was approximated with a fourth-order model, which provides two undamped natural frequencies corresponding to the longitudinal and transverse muscle stiffness. The fluctuation of the undamped natural frequencies estimated from the velocity MMG was significantly smaller than that from the acceleration MMG. There was no significant difference between the fluctuations of the undamped natural frequencies estimated from the velocity MMG and that from the displacement MMG. The proposed method using the velocity MMG is thus more advantageous for muscle stiffness estimation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an austere menace to extensively used Internet-based services. The in-time detection of DDoS attacks poses a tough challenge to network security. Revealing a low-rate DDoS (LR-DDoS) attack is comparatively more difficult in modern high speed networks, since it can easily conceal itself due to its similarity with legitimate traffic, and so eluding current anomaly based detection methods. This paper investigates the aptness and impetus of the information theory-based generalized entropy (GE) and generalized information distance (GID) metrics in detecting different types of DDoS attacks. The results of GE and GID metrics are compared with Shannon entropy and other popular information divergence measures. In addition, the feasibility of using these metrics in discriminating a high-rate DDoS (HR-DDoS) attack from a similar looking legitimate flash event (FE) is also verified. We used real and synthetically generated datasets to elucidate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed detection scheme in detecting different types of DDoS attacks and FEs. The results clearly show that the GE and GID metrics perform well in comparison with other metrics and have reduced false positive rate (FPR). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"A new disturbance automated reference toolset (DART) was developed to monitor human land surface impacts using soil-type and ecological context. DART identifies reference areas with similar soils, topography, and geology; and compares the disturbance condition to the reference area condition using a quantile-based approach based on a satellite vegetation index. DART was able to represent 26-55% of variation of relative differences in bare ground and 26-41% of variation in total foliar cover when comparing sites with nearby ecological reference areas using the Soil Adjusted Total Vegetation Index (SATVI). Assessment of ecological recovery at oil and gas pads on the Colorado Plateau with DART revealed that more than half of well-pads were below the 25th percentile of reference areas. Machine learning trend analysis of poorly recovering well-pads (quantile < 0.23) had out of-bag error rates between 37 and 40% indicating moderate association with environmental and management variables hypothesized to influence recovery. Well-pads in grasslands (median quantile (MQ] = 13%), blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima) shrublands (MQ = 18%), arid canyon complexes (MQ = 18%), warmer areas with more summer-dominated precipitation, and state administered areas (MQ = 12%) had low recovery rates. Results showcase the usefulness of DART for assessing discrete surface land disturbances, and highlight the need for more targeted rehabilitation efforts at oil and gas well-pads in the arid southwest US.

"An anomaly, or outlier, is an object exhibiting differences that suggest it belongs to an as-yet undefined class or category. Early detection of anomalies often proves of great importance because they may correspond to events such as fraud, spam, or device malfunctions. By automating the creation of a ranking or list of deviations, we can save time and decrease the cognitive overload of the individuals or groups responsible for responding to such events. Over the years many anomaly and outlier metrics have been developed. In this paper we propose a clustering-based score ensembling method for outlier detection. Using benchmark datasets we evaluate quantitatively the robustness and accuracy of different ensemble strategies. We find that ensembling strategies offer only limited value for increasing overall performance, but provide robustness by negating the influence of severely underperforming models.

"A numerical model is used to estimate the service life and clogging of gravel leachate drainage layers with a filter separator layer, such as those used in municipal solid waste landfills. A filter separator layer between the waste and the drainage layer is shown to reduce the leachate strength entering the gravel drainage layer and to extend the time that it takes to clog the drainage layer to the point when the leachate level exceeds the maximum design value (the service life). The filter layer is shown to have a far more significant effect in extending the service life when pea gravel () is used in the drainage layer, and less effect when coarse gravel () is used in the cases examined, although most of the benefit of a filter separator layer was achieved by using a 3-mm-thick needle-punched nonwoven geotextile. This geotextile may be sufficient for many practical purposes that are similar to those examined. The results from modeling leachate collection systems with filter separator layers subjected to both constant and variable leachate strength show that the characteristics of the leachate entering the drainage layer can substantially affect the service life of the drainage layer, and that high-strength leachate entering the systems for a limited time early in the life (acid phase) of a landfill can greatly reduce the service life of the leachate drainage layer.

A mathematical model of a two-span double-cable suspension bridge was created to verify the formulas. The tower-top displacement and the cable force were obtained by formulas, and the results are in good agreement with the results calculated by the FEM. The effects of some important design parameters on longitudinal restraint were studied. Analysis shows that the restraint stiffness increases with the increasing of unit weight of the bridge, dead load distribution to the top cable, sag ratio of the bottom cable, and elastic stiffness of the cables. Effects of tower-top displacement and span length were also analyzed, and some suggestions were given to design a double-cable suspension bridge.

A linear model is first considered; in this case, separation of variables is used to determine explicitly the deformation of the plate in terms of the vertical load. Moreover, the same method allows us to study the spectrum of the linear operator and the least eigenvalue. Then the stretching energy is introduced without linearization and the equation becomes quasilinear; the nonlinear term also affects the boundary conditions. We consider two quasilinear models; the surface increment model (SIM) in which the stretching energy is proportional to the increment of the surface and a nonlocal model (NLM) introduced by Berger in the 50s (see Berger (1955)).

"A psychotropic drug is defined as a drug ""capable of affecting the mind, emotions, and behavior; denoting drugs used in the treatment of mental illnesses"" (Medical Dictionary for the Health Professions and Nursing 2012). Use of these drugs can lead to urinary dysfunction, but it is often difficult to delineate whether urinary dysfunction is a direct/indirect result of drug use or secondary to an unrelated concurrent condition. This situation can therefore result in diagnostic or management dilemmas for urologists, psychiatrists, and primary care physicians. This article reviews the literature published in the last 3 years, and provides an update on the desirable and undesirable effects of psychotropic drugs on lower urinary function. Duloxetine is an antidepressant with efficacy in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence. In addition, duloxetine and desipramine have been proposed in the treatment of overactive bladder. Laboratory research into potential therapies which target the role of neurotrophins in lower urinary tract function is in progress. Narcotic analgesia, several antipsychotics, antidepressant, anticonvulsant, and stimulant medications are associated with urinary retention. Several antidepressants have been associated with nocturnal enuresis. Furthermore, ketamine is known to induce storage symptoms, with reduction in bladder capacity. Lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS)-causing drugs are associated with polypharmacy, and elderly patients are particularly susceptible to adverse events due to pharmacotherapy. Awareness of psychotropic drug side effects and rationalization of their use is important to avoid undesirable outcomes. When patients with bothersome LUTS who are on psychotropic drugs fail to benefit from simple first-line treatments for LUTS, clinicians should be mindful that the psychotropic drug may indeed be the cause of LUTS and seek to liaise with the patient's psychiatrist or primary care physician to discuss reasonable alternatives.

"A group-delay engineered noncommensurate transmission line two-port all-pass network for analog signal-processing applications is presented, analytically modeled, and experimentally demonstrated. This network consists of transversally cascaded C-sections, which are distributed implementations of the bridged-T equalizer lumped circuit. It is obtained by interconnecting the alternate ports of adjacent lines of a 2N-port coupled transmission line network with transmission line sections, and it is modeled using multiconductor transmission line theory with per-unit-length capacitance matrix C and inductance matrix L. By allowing the different C-sections of the network to exhibit different lengths, a generalized group-delay engineering procedure is proposed, where quasi-arbitrary group-delay responses are achieved by combining the group-delay responses of C-sections with different lengths. A computer design approach based on genetic algorithms is applied for synthesis, which consists of determining the structural parameters of the different C-section groups. Using this approach, noncommensurate networks are group-delay engineered in edge-coupled stripline technology, and Gaussian, linear and quadratic group-delay responses are realized. The theoretical results are validated by experiment. Finally, two application examples of analog signal processing-a tunable impulse delay line and a real-time frequency discriminator-using the proposed dispersive noncommensurate all-pass networks are presented.

"Absorption or loss is inevitable for the metal-based metamaterials (MMs) due to the intrinsic loss of the metal, and constitutes a major hurdle to the practical realization of most applications such as a sub-wavelength lens. Thus, to reduce the losses becomes one of the major challenges in the MM field. However, the inevitable loss can also be harnessed to take a positive role in the applications of MMs such as stealth technology or other types of cloaking devices. In this presentation, after a brief review of the advances in MMs-based absorbers, we present several schemes to fulfill the desired electromagnetic absorption properties, both linear and nonlinear. For linear absorption, we have experimentally demonstrated that the absorption performance of an ordinary microwave absorbing material can be evidently improved by using the electric resonance resulting from an array of subwavelength metallic circuit elements. For nonlinear absorption, we show theoretically that the active linear magnetic permeability induces a nonlinear absorption, similar to the two-photon absorption (TPA), of electric field in a lossy MM with a Kerr-type nonlinear polarization.

"A nonwoven fabric has been widely used in geotextile engineering in recent years; its tensile strength is an important behaviour. Since the fibre distributions in nonwoven fabrics are random and discontinuous, the unit-cell model of a nonwoven fabric cannot be developed to simulate its tensile behaviour. This article presents our research on using finite element method (FEM) to study the tensile behaviour of a nonwoven fabric in macro-scale based on the classical laminate composite theory. The laminate orientation was considered with orientation distribution function of fibres, which has been obtained by analysing the data acquired from scanning electron microscopy with Hough Transform. The FE model of a nonwoven fabric was developed using ABAQUS software; the required engineering constants of a nonwoven fabric were obtained from experimental data. Finally, the nonwoven specimens were stretched along with machine direction and cross direction. The experimental stress-strain curves were compared with the results of FE simulations. The approximate agreement proves the validity of an FE model, which could be used to precisely simulate the stress relaxation, strain creep, bending and shear property of a nonwoven fabric.

"A high-efficiency method is proposed to suppress magnetic core imbalance in phase-shifted full-bridge (PSFB) converters. Compared with conventional solutions, such as controlling peak current mode (PCM) or adding DC blocking capacitance, the proposed method has several advantages, such as lower power loss and smaller size, because the additional current sensor or blocking capacitor is removed. A time domain model of the secondary side is built to analyze the relationship between transformer core imbalance and cathode voltage of secondary side rectifiers. An approximate control algorithm is designed to achieve asymmetric phase control, which reduces the effects of imbalance. A 60 V/15 A prototype is built to verify the proposed method. Experimental results show that the numerical difference of primary side peak currents between two adjacent cycles is suppressed from 2 A to approximately 0 A. Meanwhile, compared with the PCM solution, the efficiency of the PSFB converter is slightly improved from 93% to 93.2%.

"1. Seasonal adaptations enabling the bridging of periodic challenging abiotic conditions are taxonomically widespread. However, sensitivity to other environmental stresses can be heightened during these periods. 2. Several temperate insects with over-wintering strategies play key ecosystem and economic roles, including wild bee pollinators. For example, hibernation survival in temperate bumblebees is crucial, as only new queens of future social colonies over-winter. These bees are also faced with other abiotic and biotic stressors, some of which have been linked to recent pollinator declines, such as exposure to pesticides and parasites. 3. Using a fully crossed experiment, the influence of dietary exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides (thiamethoxam and clothianidin) and/or the prevalent bumblebee parasite Crithidia bombi on hibernation survival and hibernation weight change of Bombus terrestris bumblebee queens was investigated. 4. Both neonicotinoid and C. bombi exposures reduced hibernation success individually, but no additive or synergistic effects between the stressors were found. Further, effects were asynchronous, with early neonicotinoid effects on hibernation mortality overriding later parasite effects under combined exposures. Neonicotinoid exposure also increased hibernation weight loss of surviving queens. 5. Diapause periods, employed by numerous temperate organisms, are likely to be especially vulnerable to environmental stresses, besides the seasonal challenge for which these periods are an adaptation. Thus, diapause requires inclusion during the consideration of the impacts of such stresses. Accordingly, it is demonstrated here that naturally relevant exposures of pesticides and parasites have important detrimental effects on bumblebees during a critical hibernation period, with potential consequences for populations of these key wild pollinators.

"A multimodal damping strategy is implemented by coupling a beam to its analogue electrical network. This network comes from the direct electromechanical analogy applied to a transverse lattice of point masses that represents the discrete model of a beam. The mechanical and electrical structures are connected together through an array of piezoelectric patches. A discrete and a semi-continuous model are proposed to describe the piezoelectric coupling. Both are based on the transfer matrix formulation and consider a finite number of patches. It is shown that a simple coupling condition gives a network that approximates the modal properties of the beam. A multimodal tuned mass effect is then obtained and a wide-band damping is introduced by choosing a suitable positioning for resistors in the network. The strategy and the models are experimentally validated by coupling a free-free beam to a completely passive network. A multimodal vibration reduction is observed, which proves the efficiency of the control solution and its potential in term of practical implementation.

"A design solution for bulk-driven tunable transconductor capable of working under extremely low supply/consumption with rail-to-rail input common-mode range is presented in this work. The proposed transconductor topology consists of six bulk-driven CMOS inverters, and it uses a very simple biasing circuit for the transconductance tuning. The design robustness was verified for 0.5 and 0.25 V power supplies offering the advantages of the current-controlled input transconductance. For 0.5 V power supply, the proposed transconductor has 0.075-10.2 transconductance tuning range, input-referred intercept point IP3 = 1.81 V, and 4.62 MHz bandwidth for 3 current consumption. The design robustness of the tunable transconductor was verified by means of computer simulation using triple-well 0.18 CMOS process.

"A self-anchored suspension bridge with a large span arrangement (210+600+200) m is designed for urban railway in the city Chongjin of China. The deck system of the bridge also has some special features. A rubber layer between the concrete slabs and the orthotropic steel deck is used to absorb the vibration energy. In order to study the fatigue behaviour of the orthotropic steel deck, a finite element model is established, and the weld in the rib-to-diaphragm region is modelled by the oblique shell element. After the reference stress was defined, the stress influence lines of the details were calculated, and then the stress ranges were counted by the rain-flow method. The nominal stress method was adopted to assess the fatigue behaviour of the concerned part. Apart from that, the circle form cut out was compared with the key form used in this bridge. Due to the stress dispersing in the concrete slab, the results show that the stress ranges keep at a relatively low level in the details of the two cut out forms. The key form of a cut out is eventually adopted because it is easy to assemble the ribs and diaphragms with a relatively large weld tolerance. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The chemical structures of these heterocycles consist of a central pyrimidine ring having a phenyl group and pyrimidine groups with sulfonamide motifs. The enzyme inhibitory potential of these compounds was investigated against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) because these enzymes play a crucial role in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. As compared to the reference compound eserine (IC50=0.04 +/- 0.0001 mu M for AChE and IC50=0.85 +/- 0.0001 mu M for BChE), the IC50 values of the synthesized compounds ranged from 3.73 +/- 0.61 mu M to 57.36 +/- 0.22 mu M for AChE and 4.81 +/- 0.16 mu M to 111.61 +/- 0.53 mu M for BChE.

"A huge amount of literature in the last decades showed that sleep is essential for children's health and well-being and that short sleep duration is associated with several negative health outcomes. Many developmental phases in infancy and childhood are in strict relationship with an healthy sleep. In the last years some specific recommendations made for how much sleep children need have been published. The empirical evidences for contemporary sleep recommendations has changed and the new recommendations are clearly different from the previous ones and reflect clearly the changes in the sleep need of the children and adolescents in the last decades although seem still to be largely unfitting for preadolescence and adolescence. If sleep is to be treated as a therapeutic intervention, then consensus guidelines, statements, and evidence-based best-practice documents are needed to underpin sleep recommendations for children. Sleep recommendations for children play an important role for public policies and interventions, and to advertise parents and children of the negative consequences of sleep deprivation/reduction.

"Adolescence is a developmental period marked by considerable biological, social, and psychological changes, with rates of self-reported stress on the rise mirroring those of adults. Mindfulness interventions are increasingly being implemented in high schools to improve students' stress management and psychosocial outcomes. Despite the well-researched role of primary and secondary control strategies in the management of adolescent stress, the impact of mindfulness on these attributions has not been examined. The current study addressed this gap in the extant literature. A mindfulness-based martial arts program was delivered to 17 high school students at risk for self-regulation challenges. Measures of primary and secondary control and cognitive errors were completed at pre- and post-treatment and compared to a waitlist control (n = 18). Findings suggested that students in the mindfulness program showed significant improvements in secondary control and reductions in cognitive errors from pre- to post-treatment compared to the waitlist control. No significant group by time changes were found for primary control. Findings are discussed in relation to changes in control-related attributions associated with cognitive behavioral therapy, with specific consideration of possible mechanisms by which mindfulness may improve secondary control and decrease cognitive errors. Directions for future research are discussed.

"A graph-theoretic formulation for the sensitivity analysis of multi-domain dynamic systems is presented in this article. In this formulation, a linear graph is used to capture the system topology and a graph-theoretic formulation is used to generate the system equations and the sensitivity equations simultaneously from the linear graph. Symbolic generation ensures automated, accurate, and efficient generation of sensitivity equations. The proposed method of sensitivity analysis avoids differentiation of complicated algebraic expressions, and the corresponding equation swells, by using pre-formed (and stored) expressions that are combined according to the topology captured by the linear graph. To illustrate the application of graph-theoretic sensitivity analysis to multi-domain systems, an electric motor-driven slider-crank mechanism and an automotive torque converter are considered as examples. The generation of the sensitivity equations is demonstrated, and the results are validated using a finite difference formulation. Also, the efficiencies of the generated equations are gauged by measuring the associated computational costs. Finally, some features of multi-domain multibody systems that pose unique challenges to the theory and software implementation are presented, along with a brief description of the symbolic software platform that has been used to implement the algorithm.

"Adapting application to diverse/dynamic domains is required to enlarge pervasive computing use and to satisfy people demand in terms of continuity of services. In addition, the proliferation of smart devices and ubiquitous services motivate the need for a quick development of applications that support people in dynamic domains. Inappropriately, this quick development is often associated a discard of domain knowledge. Therefore, we target in our research raising the level of adaptation for rapid application development in dynamic domains. In this paper, we present our work to improve the formal definition of domain knowledge/applications to be created by domain experts. We propose our context-based semantic framework (i.e., AmI-DEU) used to create dynamic domain models that are the basis for building applications. In this framework, domain knowledge is described by means of meaningful context that include unambiguous terms and operations, resulting in an enhancement of adaptation of applications. We also present in this paper the applicability of the framework to describe dynamic domains and context-based services, as well as, to develop micro context-aware applications that negotiate and interchange context, and consume services in multiple computational spaces.

"A modified Gaussian current density is put forward, which is used to simulate the dynamic process of AZ31B magnesium alloy double-electrode gas metal arc welding (DE-GMAW) droplet transfer. The process of droplet transfer in the AZ31B magnesium alloy DE-GMAW was simulated using FLUENT software. The influence of different bypass welding currents was investigated with a constant total current. The simulated results revealed that when the bypass current was 0 A, the process was the globular transfer type, the droplet transfer with a bypass current of 80 A was a projected transfer type and the droplet transfer at a bypass current of 170 A was a spray transfer type. The critical current is decreased so that spray transfer would occur at a lower current level in the DE-GMAW process. As the bypass current was increased, the shape of droplet changed from oval to round and the transition frequency of the droplet increased in a stepwise fashion. To confirm the accuracy of the simulated results, welding experiments were performed and the image processing method was used to obtain the droplet size. The simulated and experimental results were found to be in good agreement.

Our simulation results demonstrate that this technique provides better SINR improvement over to Nonlinear predictor, Linear predictor, Kalman-Bucy predictor for -65 dB to -5 dB input SINR and up to 10 dB AWGN power. For high interfering signal and noise power, our results clearly show that our SINR improvement performance exceeds the SINR improvement upper-bound calculated for the prediction based techniques. Besides reducing the effect of interfering signal, our technique also reduces AWGN noise. Our model also provides better BER performance than Nonlinear predictor.

"A giant leap has been made in the past couple of decades with the introduction of kernel-based learning as a mainstay for designing effective nonlinear computational learning algorithms. In view of the geometric interpretation of conditional expectation and the ubiquity of multiscale characteristics in highly complex nonlinear dynamic systems [1]-[3], this paper presents a new orthogonal projection operator wavelet kernel, aiming at developing an efficient computational learning approach for nonlinear dynamical system identification. In the framework of multiresolution analysis, the proposed projection operator wavelet kernel can fulfill the multiscale, multidimensional learning to estimate complex dependencies. The special advantage of the projection operator wavelet kernel developed in this paper lies in the fact that it has a closed-form expression, which greatly facilitates its application in kernel learning. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first closed-form orthogonal projection wavelet kernel reported in the literature. It provides a link between grid-based wavelets and mesh-free kernel-based methods. Simulation studies for identifying the parallel models of two benchmark nonlinear dynamical systems confirm its superiority in model accuracy and sparsity.

"Ambient intelligence environments are technologically augmented surroundings that aim to provide personalized services to the users based on their context. Identifying these services for the users has become an increasingly challenging task. The overwhelming number of services in the ambient environment has made the selection and management of services even more challenging.

Most of these techniques obtain the preference of a user based on his/her own interaction and profile and do not consider the power of collaborative selection approach.

"A new image analysis algorithm based on mathematical morphology and pixel classification for grapevine berry counting is presented in this paper. First, a set of berry candidates represented by connected components was extracted. Then, six descriptors were calculated using key features of these components, and were employed for false positive (FP) discrimination using a supervised approach. More specifically, the set of descriptors modelled the grapes' distinctive shape, light reflection pattern and colour. Two classifiers were tested, a three-layer neural network and an optimised support vector machine. A dataset of 152 images was acquired with a low-cost smart phone camera. Images came from seven grapevine varieties, 18 per variety, at the two phenological stages in the Baggiolini scale between berry set (named stage K; 94 images) and cluster-closure (named stage L; 32 images). 126 of these images were kept for external validation and the remaining 26 were used for training (12 at stage L and 14 at K). From these training images, 5438 true/false positive samples were generated and labelled in terms of the six descriptors. The neural network performed better than the support vector machine, yielding consistent Recall and Precision average values of 0.9572 and 0.8705, respectively. The presented algorithm, implemented as a smartphone application, can constitute a useful diagnosis tool for the in-the-field and non-destructive yield prediction and berry set assessing for the grape and wine industry.

"A NoSQL, also called a ""Non-Relational"" or ""Not only SQL,"" database system provides an approach to data management and database design for very large sets of distributed data and real-time web applications. A NoSQL database system is also a popular data storage for information retrieval because it supports better scalability, availability, and faster data access while comparing with traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS). What the RDBMS data needs is predictable as its data is stored in structured tables by defining the relationship between the different columns. In contrary the data in NoSQL databases does not need to be stored in a structured or fixed fashion. When performance and realtime access are more concerned than consistency, such as indexing and retrieving large numbers of records, NoSQL databases are more suitable than relational databases. With their obvious advantages in better performance, scalability, and flexibility, NoSQL databases have been adopted lately by many small businesses as they are moving their increasing business data into the clouds. However, the research on the security of a specific NoSQL database system or NoSQL database systems in general is very limited. Although there are many storage advantages in NoSQL databases, the need of quick and easy access to data has been seriously affected by the security issue of NoSQL databases.

This study employs a mass balance based method to estimate RWH performance for four large metropolitan areas of the United States, namely New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Seattle. Geospatial analysis is used in concert with climatic records to characterize the cityscape and climatic patterns of each city and evaluate the RWH systems performance both in terms of potable water savings and roof runoff reductions. The analysis indicates that typical urban rainwater harvesting setups, consisting of a 100 m(2) roof connected to a 5m(3) storage volume, would be able to reduce potable water demand by over 65% in all cities while contextually reduce roof runoff generation by over 75%. Small differences in performance are observed among cities due to differences in precipitation patterns, typical roof area, and population density. Furthermore, an evaluation of the total water savings and runoff reduction for the application of RWH practices at maximum build out for all four study cities is provided, and the sensitivity of our estimates of performance to precipitation patterns and to the systems' operating algorithm is also analyzed and discussed.

The optimum BGE provided both the baseline electrophoretic separation of the drugs and highly compatible connection of CE to the electro-spray ionization (ESI) interface. The optimized working conditions were favorable for the selective and sensitive QqQ MS detection of the separated compounds according to their mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios. The proposed method was validated in terms of precision (RSDs for the repeatability of migration times and peak areas of the analyzed drugs were less than 1.66 and 6.06%, respectively), linearity (determination coefficient ranged in the interval of 0.9987-0.9995), limits of quantitation (sub A mu g mL(-1) levels), and accuracy (mean recoveries of all the analytes in pharmaceutical matrix ranged in the interval of 98.23-101.2%). The CE-ESI-QqQ MS method is fast, simple, selective, precise, and accurate, and was successfully applied to a highly reliable determination of the targeted drugs (for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, IBD) in commercial pharmaceuticals (tablet dosage forms).

"A three-year field experiment was conducted to determine how integrating different furrow-applied mulches would influence the yield and water use efficiency (WUE) for corn (Zea mays L.) cultivated under a plastic-covered ridge and furrow rainwater harvesting (PRFRH) system in semi-arid lands of China's Loess Plateau. The effect of the mulching treatments in combination with PRFRH was compared to the conventional flat (control, T-1). The furrow-applied mulching treatments and their designation were: none or bare furrow (T-2); liquid film (T-3); 8% biodegradable film (T-4); 10-cm thick layer of corn stover (T-5); and 0.08mm thick plastic film (T-6). Corn was planted in the furrows on either side of the plastic-covered ridges of the plots for treatments T-2 though T-6. Soil moisture was measured gravimetrically on auger samples taken at 6 locations in each plot at intervals of 20cm from the 0 to 200cm depth. In all years, soil moisture storage at the 0100cm depth was significantly higher (pT-4>T-3>T-2>T-5>T-1, indicating that mulching most likely reduced soil evaporation losses and suggesting that integrated PRFRH+mulch systems has potential to increase crop sustainability in this semiarid region.

"An effective theory-based intervention strategy is developed to improve worker adoption of a ventilated dust-control tool that reduces dust exposure by 95%. The Prevention through Design Adoption Readiness Model (PtD ARM) was employed to develop educational materials, hands-on training, and worksite cues-to-action. Educational materials were targeted to improve worker knowledge of the health risks associated with construction dusts. Hands-on training was developed with the objective of improving worker self-efficacy regarding the new equipment. Additionally cues-to-action were given to the workers. These cues were hard-hat stickers and t-shirts with reminder slogans. In a pretest/posttest experimental design with control group (n=40), questionnaire data were analyzed using independent t-tests of the gain-scores, and significant changes (p<0.05) were seen in worker self-efficacy, trust-in-technology, and overall readiness to adopt the tool. Theory-based intervention strategies were found to be effective in improving worker willingness to use ventilated tools. The most impactful intervention methods include training regarding risks to worker health, hands-on training with ventilated tools, and cues-to-action reminders to use the tools.

"A smart camera is a vision system capable of extracting application-specific information from the captured images. The paper proposes a decentralized and efficient solution for visual parking lot occupancy detection based on a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) specifically designed for smart cameras. This solution is compared with state-of-the-art approaches using two visual datasets: PKLot, already existing in literature, and CNRParlc-EXT. The former is an existing dataset, that allowed us to exhaustively compare with previous works. The latter dataset has been created in the context of this research, accumulating data across various seasons of the year, to test our approach in particularly challenging situations, exhibiting occlusions, and diverse and difficult viewpoints. This dataset is public available to the scientific community and is another contribution of our research. Our experiments show that our solution outperforms and generalizes the best performing approaches on both datasets. The performance of our proposed CNN architecture on the parking lot occupancy detection task, is comparable to the well-known AlexNet, which is three orders of magnitude larger.

"A parallelized numerical contour integral based method is proposed for counting interior eigenvalues in a given region on the complex plane. The proposed method is derived from descriptor system of power system linearized model and complex analysis theory, based on which the computation of eigenvalue number is converted to a set of matrix trace problems. The contour integral results are able to be utilized to detect missing target eigenvalues in partial eigenvalue methods and provide an approximate eigenvalue distribution along the integral curve. Efficient evaluation of integral function is implemented by exploiting the sparsity of descriptor systems. An adaptive integral point collocation strategy is proposed for numerically evaluating contour integral with moderate number of discretized points. As the computation of integral function is decoupled at each integral point, the proposed method features well parallel computing capability.

"A small electrical generator based on vibrations and using the efficient electromagnetic transduction mechanism is presented. The system is using a magnetic core made of FINEMET nanocrystalline ribbons with specific magnetic properties to harvest and convert the energy of vibrations into the active energy, at a maximum efficiency of about 50%. The system consists of a pair of movable magnets attached to an elastic lamella working as cantilever and fixed coil. When subjected to vibrations, the oscillation of the permanent magnets induces an electromotive force in the coil surrounding the magnetic core. A model that simulates the behavior of the small electrical generator is proposed. The model provides information about the influence of different parameters on the transduction mechanism, the optimal conversion efficiency, and the reliability of the system, being extremely useful to properly design the energy harvester.

"A number of methods, both algebraic and iterative, have been developed recently for the fitting of concentric circles. Previous studies focus on first-order analysis for performance evaluation, which is appropriate only when the observation noise is small so that the bias is insignificant compared to variance. Further studies indicate that the first-order analysis does not appear sufficient in explaining and predicting the performance of an estimator for the fitting problem, especially when the noise level becomes significant. This paper extends the previous study to perform the second-order analysis and evaluate the estimation bias of several concentric circle estimators. The second-order analysis exposes important characteristics of the estimators that cannot be seen from the first-order studies. The insights gained in the theoretical study have led to the development of a new estimator that is unbiased and performs best among the algebraic solutions. An adjusted maximum likelihood estimator is also proposed that can yield an unbiased estimate while maintaining the KCR bound performance.

"A MapReduce algorithm can be described by a mapping schema, which assigns inputs to a set of reducers, such that for each required output there exists a reducer that receives all the inputs participating in the computation of this output. Reducers have a capacity that limits the sets of inputs they can be assigned. However, individual inputs may vary in terms of size. We consider, for the first time, mapping schemas where input sizes are part of the considerations and restrictions. One of the significant parameters to optimize in any MapReduce job is communication cost between the map and reduce phases. The communication cost can be optimized by minimizing the number of copies of inputs sent to the reducers. The communication cost is closely related to the number of reducers of constrained capacity that are used to accommodate appropriately the inputs, so that the requirement of how the inputs must meet in a reducer is satisfied. In this work, we consider a family of problems where it is required that each input meets with each other input in at least one reducer. We also consider a slightly different family of problems in which each input of a list, X, is required to meet each input of another list, Y, in at least one reducer. We prove that finding an optimal mapping schema for these families of problems is NP-hard, and present a bin-packing-based approximation algorithm for finding a near optimal mapping schema.

"A large variety of molecular pathways in melanoma progression suggests that no individual molecular alteration is crucial in itself. Our aim was to define the molecular alterations underlying metastasis formation. Gene expression profiling was performed using microarray and qRT-PCR to define alterations between matched primary and metastatic melanoma cell lines. These data were integrated with publicly available unmatched tissue data. The invasiveness of cell lines was determined by Matrigel invasion assays and invasive clones from primary melanoma-derived cell lines were also selected. Two metastatic cell line models were created: the regional lymph node WM983A-WM983A(INV)-WM983B and the distant lung WM793B-WM793B(INV)-1205Lu metastatic models. The majority of metastasis genes were downregulated and enriched in adhesion and ITGA6-B4 pathways. Upregulation of immune pathways was characteristic of distant metastases, whereas increased Rap1 signaling was specific for regional (sub) cutaneous metastases. qRT-PCR analysis of selected integrins (A2, A3, A4, A9, B5, B8, A6, B1, and B3) highlighted the possible importance of ITGA3/4 and B8 in the metastatic process, distinguishing regional and distant metastases. We identified functionally relevant gene clusters that influenced metastasis formation. Our data provide further evidence that integrin expression patterns may be important in distant metastasis formation. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

"A new data-driven model has been developed to determine 1D/2D particle size distribution (PSD) from measured FBRM chord-length distribution (CLD) data. The structure of the model consists of three steps: first, the measured CLDs are compressed down to a small set of parameters; second, these parameters are correlated with low order moments or a small number of percentiles of the PSD using regression models; third, the PSD low order moments are used as input variables, and a two layer-network sub-model is built to predict the PSD in a form of a histogram. Two key aspects of this modeling strategy are noteworthy, namely the construction of specialized parameterized functions (herein called generating functions) that reduce the number of parameters needed to train the model's two layer network component, as well as its ability to model a 2D size distribution. To demonstrate this paradigm, the model was used to determine the PSD of particles with an elongated morphology. It is shown that even with a limited data set, models could be trained to predict PSD generated by laser diffraction, minor size PSD generated by image analysis, and 2D minor-major PSD measured by image analysis.

"Allocating tasks to processors is a well-known NP-Hard problem in distributed computing systems. Due to the lack of practicable exact solutions, it has been attracted by the researchers working on heuristic based suboptimal search algorithms. With the recent inclusion of multiple objectives such as minimizing the cost, maximizing, the throughput and maximizing the reliability, the problem gets even more complex and an efficient approximate method becomes more valuable. In this work, I propose a new solution for the multi-objective task allocation problem. My solution consists in designing a problem-specific neighboring function for an existing metaheuristic algorithm that is proven to be successful in quadratic assignment problems. The neighboring function, namely greedy reassignment with maximum release (GR-MR), provides a dynamic mechanism to switch the preference of the search between the exploration and exploitation. The experiments validate both that the quality of the solutions are close to the optimal and the proposed method performs significantly better comparing to three other metaheuristic algorithms. Neighboring functions being the common reusable components of metaheuristic algorithms, GR-MR can also be utilized by other metaheuristic-based solutions in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"A comparative study of different models and identification techniques applied to the quantification of valve stiction in industrial control loops is presented in this paper, with the objective of taking into account for the presence of external disturbances. A Hammerstein system is used to model the controlled process (linear block) and the sticky valve (nonlinear block): five different candidates for the linear block and two different candidates for the nonlinear block are evaluated and compared. Two of the five linear models include a nonstationary disturbance term that is estimated along with the input-to-output model, and these extended models are meant to cope with situations in which significant nonzero mean disturbances affect the collected data. The comparison of the different models and identification methods is carried out thoroughly in three steps: simulation, application to pilot plant data and application to industrial loops. In the first two cases (simulation and pilot plant) the specific source of fault (stiction with/without external disturbances) is known and hence a validation of each candidate can be carried out more easily. Nonetheless, each fault case considered in the previous two steps has been found in the application to a large number of datasets collected from industrial loops, and hence the merits and limitations of each candidate have been confirmed. As a result of this study, extended models are proved to be effective when large, time varying disturbances affect the system, whereas conventional (stationary) noise models are more effective elsewhere.

"A series of SiO2@aluminum-MOF(MIL-68) composites with different SiO2 loadings have been synthesized by a simple and mild compositing strategy for high-efficiency removal of aniline. As evidenced from SEM and TEM images as well as the particle size distribution, the incorporation of SiO2 can improve the dispersity of MIL-68(Al) in composites, and result in the smaller particle size than that of pristine MIL-68(Al). Besides, the adsorption of aniline over SiO2, MIL-68(Al), the physical mixture of these two materials, and SiO2@MIL-68(Al) composites was investigated comparatively, demonstrating a relatively high adsorption capacity (531.9 mg g(-1)) of 7% SiO2@MIL-68(Al) towards aniline. Combining the ultrafast adsorption dynamics (reaching equilibrium within 40 s) and great reusability, 7% SiO2@MIL-68(Al) shows excellent adsorption performance.

"A multitude of contemporary applications now involve graph data whose size continuously grows and this trend shows no signs of subsiding. This has caused the emergence of many distributed graph processing systems including Pre-gel and Apache Giraph. However, the unprecedented scale now reached by real-world graphs hardens the task of graph processing even in distributed environments and the current memory usage patterns rapidly become a primary concern for such contemporary graph processing systems. We seek to address this challenge by exploiting empirically-observed properties demonstrated by graphs that are generated by human activity. In this paper, we propose three space-efficient adjacency list representations that can be applied to any distributed graph processing system. Our suggested compact representations reduce respective memory requirements for accommodating the graph elements up to 5 times if compared with state-of-the-art methods. At the same time, our memory-optimized methods retain the efficiency of uncompressed structures and enable the execution of algorithms for large scale graphs in settings where contemporary alternative structures fail due to memory errors.

"A large number of methods have been applied to evaluate genotoxic damage in different aquatic species. Comet assay, as a method for detecting DNA alterations, and micronucleus test, as an index of chromosomal damage are the most widely used and authentic methods in laboratory and field studies. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the genotoxic effects of heavy metals generated by toxic industrial effluents and various kinds of pollutants from urban and agricultural areas and domestic waste on Catla catla and Cirrhinus mrigala due to water pollution in the Chenab River, Pakistan. The heavy metals Cd, Cu, Mn. Zn, Pb, Cr, Sn, and Hg were detected by atomic absorption spectrophotometry from water samples collected from predetermined sampling sites. All the physicochemical parameters and heavy metals were found to exceed the upper limits recommended by various agencies. Comet assays showed significant (p < 0.05) DNA damage in C. mrigala compared to C. catla for tail length and olive tail moment from three different sites. Significant (p0.05) findings were observed between fish collected from farmed and non-polluted upstream waters. Micronucleus assays showed similar findings for single and double micronucleus induction in C. catla and C. mrigala. A significantly (p < 0.05) higher micronuclei induction and percent tail DNA was observed in C. mrigala specimen collected from the polluted site. These findings infer that DNA damage could be used as a biomarker of pollution load and its early monitoring by using simple and reliable techniques such as the comet and micronucleus assays, expedient methods for toxicity screening of aquatic environments. Regular monitoring is necessary to assess eco-health of the Chenab River by choosing perhaps C. mrigala, being a bottom feeder, as a bioindicator that could provide more reliable information to determine the status of the environmental quality of the river.

Viral infections may be associated with IPF and other fibrotic lung diseases. In the present study, we investigate for the first time in Iran the related viral etiology of IPF in order to detect three respiratory viruses; human adenovirus, enterovirus and bocavirus. Materials and methods: In this cross-sectional study which was supported by Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. The diagnostic criteria for IPF were based on internationally accepted clinical and imaging criteria in accordance with the 2011 IPF guidelines. 30 nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs or broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) samples were obtained from the lung of IPF patients that were diagnosed by a sophisticated practitioner from April 2015 to February 2016. Real-time (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was performed to detect the three viruses. Fluorescence dye of a labeled probe recorded the results in order to create positive and negative controls. SPSS version 20 software was used to calculate basic descriptive and frequency features. Results: Of 30 specimens, 13 (43.4%) were male and 17 (56.6%) were female with the total mean age standard deviation 68.2 +/- 12.0. RT-PCR assay results illustrated there was no infection of human adenovirus, enterovirus, and bocavirus detected in these samples. Significant results between IPF incidence and variables were not significant (p >0.05).

"A pod is a propeller propulsion device installed externally to the ship's hull. The pod system comprises a short propulsion shaft, on which the propulsion electric motor is mounted. In most cases, propulsion is achieved by means of fixed pitch propellers powered by an AC synchronous motor (conventional, permanent magnet) or asynchronous electric motor, fitted inside the pod. Amongst the highest failure indices are those of main electric motor parts, such as the stator windings and core, the rotor windings and the slip ring electric connectors. These high failure rates are attributed mainly to the high temperature development in windings, leading to excessive overheating stresses, indicating that the motors have not been properly selected according to the stressful conditions they are subject to operate in. This paper deals with the design procedure of a surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor for application as a podded main propulsion motor. Specifically, it is an Azipod system that is an outboard marine propulsion unit, in which the engine is out of the hull, is rotatable around itself and the shaft is directly connected to the propeller.

"Accurate estimates of biomass are required for relating ecosystem functioning to atmospheric carbon regulation. Biomass may be directly measured through field sampling, which can then be used to calibrate biomass predictions from remote sensing and/or modelling. Field sampling generally entails measuring the fresh mass of individual trees or shrubs and then estimating the moisture contents of a representative sub-samples, which are then used to calculate dry mass. Because any errors in the estimation of the moisture content (MC) correction are translated proportionally to the biomass prediction of an individual tree or shrub, care is required to ensure MC estimates are unbiased and as precise as possible. There are numerous different protocols currently applied to attain MC, with these differing in accuracy (bias and precision) and cost of implementation. A dataset of MC of above-ground biomass (AGB) of 1396 individuals (trees or shrubs) was used to assess which protocols for within- and among-individual sampling are likely to provide the most cost-effective estimates of MC within acceptable bounds of accuracy. Monte Carlo analysis was used to explore key sources of error in within-individual MC estimation. Results suggest these MC estimates may be based on at least the bole and crown components of AGB, with bias resulting if MC is based on stem wood only, particularly in young (or small) individuals. Little gain in accuracy was attained with more intensive sub-sampling (e.g. into foliage, twig, branches, bark, and stem wood components). Moreover, further efficiencies may be gained by applying existing empirical models to estimate the proportion of AGB that is crown based on easily measured variables such as stem diameter, thereby avoiding the resource-intensive process of partitioning to obtain fresh weights measurements of components. However to minimise bias, it is important to undertake MC sampling at each study site, and to stratify sampling among-individuals by both appropriate taxonomic grouping (e.g. plant functional type) and age-class. For a given plant functional type-by-size (or age) strata at a given site a precision of about 4% coefficient of variation of the average MC estimate can be achieved with intensive within- and among-individual sampling. However a precision of 8-10% is achievable using our recommended less intensive but more efficient protocol; derive an average MC for at least six individuals, and for each individual, intensively sub-sample bole and crown components for MC, which is then applied to the fresh weights of these components. This latter estimate may be obtained from partitioning of the AGB, or for the highest efficiency, from predictions obtained from the application of existing representative empirical relationships of partitioning based on the size of the individual.

"Abnormal buildup of the microtubule associated protein tau is a major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and various tauopathies. The mechanisms by which pathological tau accumulates and spreads throughout the brain remain largely unknown. Previously, we demonstrated that a restoration of the major astrocytic glutamate transporter, GLT1, ameliorated a buildup of tau pathology and rescued cognition in a mouse model of AD. We hypothesized that aberrant extracellular glutamate and abnormal neuronal excitatory activities promoted tau pathology. In the present study, we investigated genetic interactions between tau and the GLT1 homolog dEaatl in Drosophila melanogaster. Neuronal-specific overexpression of human wildtype tau markedly shortened lifespan and impaired motor behavior. RNAi depletion of dEaatl in astrocytes worsened these phenotypes, whereas overexpression of dEaatl improved them. However, the synaptic neuropil appeared unaffected, and we failed to detect any major neuronal loss with tau overexpression in combination with dEaatl depletion. To mimic glutamate-induced aberrant excitatory input in neurons, repeated depolarization of neurons via transgenic TrpA1 was applied to the adult Drosophila optic nerves, and we examined the change of tau deposits. Repeated depolarization significantly increased the accumulation of tau in these neurons. We propose that increased neuronal excitatory activity exacerbates tau mediated neuronal toxicity and behavioral deficits. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"A new approach for the unified treatment of frictional contact and orthotropic plasticity at finite strains using semi-smooth Newton methods is presented. The contact discretization is based on the well-known mortar finite element method using dual Lagrange multipliers to facilitate the handling of the additional Lagrange multiplier degrees of freedom. Exploiting the similarity of the typical inequality constraints of plasticity and friction, all involved discrete inequalities are reformulated as nonlinear non-smooth equations using complementarity functions. The resulting set of discrete semi-smooth equations can be solved efficiently by a variant of Newton's method, where all additionally introduced variables are condensed from the global system so that a linear system only consisting of the displacement degrees of freedom has to be solved in each iteration step. In contrast to classical radial return mapping methods for computational plasticity, the plastic constraints are not required to hold at every iterate in the nonlinear solution procedure, but only at convergence. This relaxation in the pre-asymptotic behavior results in an increased flexibility regarding algorithm design and a potentially higher robustness compared to radial return mapping algorithms. The presented elasto-plasticity algorithm includes arbitrary isotropic hyperelasticity, an anisotropic Hill-type yield function with isotropic and kinematic hardening, plastic spin and appropriate finite element technology for nearly incompressible materials. Therefore, it is well suited for the modeling of sheet metal forming and similar processes. Several numerical examples underline the robustness of the proposed plasticity algorithm and the efficient treatment of elasto-plastic contact problems. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The prevalence of HCV infection among dialysis patients in Japan, Europe, and North America during the 2012 to 2015 period was found to be 8.7% in the DOPPS study. Nosocomial HCV spread in hemodialysis facilities still occurs. Increased hepatic tissue iron has been shown to play a deleterious role in the course of hepatitis C, favor development of fibrosis and cirrhosis and possibly increase the risk of liver cancer in the general population. Regular loss of blood in the hemodialysis circuit, in routine blood sampling for laboratory tests (for uremia monitoring), and in gut due to uremic enteropathy, invariably results in iron deficiency for which patients are commonly treated with intravenous (IV) iron preparations. Data on the effects of IV iron in hemodialysis patients with hepatitis C are limited (2 studies) and strongly suggest that parenteral iron may contribute to hepatocellular injury. Iatrogenic iron overload is extremely prevalent among hemodialysis population worldwide. Iron overload and toxicity has emerged as one of the most controversial topic in the management of anemia in dialysis patients. Given the known impact of iron in promoting growth and virulence of HCV and the associated liver disease, it is necessary to use iron therapy cautiously and closely monitor plasma markers of iron metabolism and liver iron stores non-invasively by means of MRI to avoid iron overload in this vulnerable population.

"Accurate and timely information of construction project progress in a regular repeated basis is one of the critical stages of construction management. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of field data capturing technologies (FDCT), in combination with building information modelling (BIM) on automated construction project progress monitoring (ACPPM). The research is based on a survey of contracting and engineering consulting firms operating in the Middle East, Mid-Asia, Europe, North America, and Far East. Based on an evaluation of the findings, 3D Laser Scanning (LS), Image-based, and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies in combination with BIM were found as the most used technologies for ACPPM. At the end, a conceptual framework is illustrated and managerial implications are highlighted with a sample statement focusing on requirements, processes and benefits. The study confirms the importance of using BIM-based FDCT in enhancing ACPPM factors performance. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Advances in the treatment of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) represent an urgent, unmet medical need for patients with this category of diffuse parenchymal lung disease. IIPs involve varying combinations of fibrosis and inflammation of unknown cause and may be associated with pulmonary hypertension (PH). When it occurs, PH is associated with higher oxygen needs, greater functional impairment, and increased mortality. However, whether or when PH is a maladaptive versus adaptive phenomenon remains to be determined. Despite their differing prognoses, it does appear that the IIPs may follow a similar course once PH supervenes. Therefore, it may be worthwhile to explore studies of PH medications in IIP as a group rather than as individual entities. Such a broad approach eliminates the need to nuance specific diagnoses and thereby facilitates study recruitment and broadens the applicability of the results. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Algorithms for extracting hydrologic features and properties from digital elevation models (DEMs) are challenged by large datasets, which often cannot fit within a computer's RAM. Depression filling is an important preconditioning step to many of these algorithms. Here, I present a new, linearly scaling algorithm which parallelizes the Priority-Flood depression-filling algorithm by subdividing a DEM into tiles. Using a single-producer, multi-consumer design, the new algorithm works equally well on one core, multiple cores, or multiple machines and can take advantage of large memories or cope with small ones. Unlike previous algorithms, the new algorithm guarantees a fixed number of memory access and communication events per subdivision of the DEM. In comparison testing, this results in the new algorithm running generally faster while using fewer resources than previous algorithms. For moderately sized tiles, the algorithm exhibits similar to 60% strong and weak scaling efficiencies up to 48 cores, and linear time scaling across datasets ranging over three orders of magnitude. The largest dataset on which I run the algorithm has 2 trillion (2 x 10(12)) cells. With 48 cores, processing required 4.8 h wall-time (93 compute-days). This test is three orders of magnitude larger than any previously performed in the literature. Complete, well commented source code and correctness tests are available for download from a repository.

"A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), 3 kbp upstream of the IL28B gene (rs12979860; C/T), has been shown to influence the dynamics of cytomegalovirus (CMV) replication in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients (Allo-SCT). We investigated whether this SNP had any effect on the dynamics of CMV-specific T-cell immunity in these patients. CMV pp65/IE-1 IFN-gamma CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells were enumerated by flow cytometry in 85 patients with no prior CMV DNAemia (group A) and in 57 after the onset of CMV DNAemia (group B). Donor IL28B genotype was determined by real-time PCR and plasma levels of IL-28B were quantitated by ELISA. CMV-specific T-cell counts and plasma IL-28B levels in patients in group A were not significantly different among the IL28B genotype groups. Patients harboring the donor IL28B T/T genotype appeared to expand CMV-specific IFN-gamma CD8(+) cells to a higher level in response to viral replication than their C/T and C/C counterparts. Fewer patients in the T/T group received pre-emptive antiviral therapy (P = 0.05). Overall, a significant inverse correlation was observed between median IL-28B levels measured prior to the CMV DNAemia onset and the level of CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells enumerated after detection of CMV DNAemia (s = -0.471; P = 0.013). In summary, the data suggested that the protective effect attributed to the rs12979860 SNP minor T allele could be mediated, at least in part, by eliciting robust CMV-specific T-cell responses.

An invitation and link to an electronic survey were emailed to nurse managers of 91 maternal newborn units and NICUs in Ontario, Canada, and 40 completed surveys were submitted (44%). Results showed variable but infrequent use of pain reduction strategies. Barriers were coded as health care provider (HCP), infant, parent and organizational factors. Most barriers related to BF and SSC and included: preference to perform blood sampling without parents; parental preference to not be involved during blood sampling; unit cultures; out of date policies; insufficient time, knowledge and education; and staff being uncomfortable performing blood sampling with infants BF or held SSC.

"A modern understanding of how cerebral cortical lesions develop after acute brain injury is based on Aristides Le (a) over tilde $o's historic discoveries of spreading depression and asphyxial/anoxic depolarization. Treated as separate entities for decades, we now appreciate that these events define a continuum of spreading mass depolarizations, a concept that is central to understanding their pathologic effects. Within minutes of acute severe ischemia, the onset of persistent depolarization triggers the breakdown of ion homeostasis and development of cytotoxic edema. These persistent changes are diagnosed as diffusion restriction in magnetic resonance imaging and define the ischemic core. In delayed lesion growth, transient spreading depolarizations arise spontaneously in the ischemic penumbra and induce further persistent depolarization and excitotoxic damage, progressively expanding the ischemic core. The causal role of these waves in lesion development has been proven by real-time monitoring of electrophysiology, blood flow, and cytotoxic edema. The spreading depolarization continuum further applies to other models of acute cortical lesions, suggesting that it is a universal principle of cortical lesion development. These pathophysiologic concepts establish a working hypothesis for translation to human disease, where complex patterns of depolarizations are observed in acute brain injury and appear to mediate and signal ongoing secondary damage.

"A comprehensive assessment on lake water quality was carried out in Shahu Lake, northwest China, to provide valuable information about present lake water quality for decision making. Major ions, general parameters, bacteriological parameters, organics and trace metals monitored monthly in 2014 were considered. Monitored parameters were compared with quality criteria for surface water of China, and overall water quality assessment was carried out using an entropy weighted water quality index (EWQI) based on 20 selected parameters. Lake water quality was also assessed for irrigation purpose. The results show that the lake water is of Cl center dot SO4-Na facies with high salinity and COD. The geochemistry of the lake water is regulated by intense evaporation and human activities. TP, TN and F- are major inorganic contaminants, with over 50% of the water samples polluted by them. Oil, mainly attributed by leaky motor tourist boats, is the major organic pollutants in the lake water, with 10 samples (37.04%) showing higher oil content than the permissible limit. The concentrations of other inorganic and organic contaminants as well as trace metals are well below the permissible limits. The present study indicates that inorganic contamination in the lake water is more severe than organic pollution. The overall lake water quality, assessed by EWQI, is poor and very poor with SO42-, TDS, TH and Cl-being the dominant contributing factors. The lake water is suitable for irrigation in terms of alkalinity, but is unsuitable for irrigation from the salinity point of view. Accelerating the circulation and replenishment of the lake water is an important way of reducing contaminant concentrations. This study is important in providing comprehensive information on lake water quality for decision makers and valuable reference for international lake water researchers.

"A recent upsurge of investment in photovoltaic (PV) industry in China has made outstanding contributions to the adjustment of energy structure. In order to further promote the investment and construction of PV projects, the state has published many fiscal subsidy policies. In addition to unified national subsidy standard, local standards have been developed according to local fiscal revenue. They either have greatly improved return on investment (ROI) or have no significant effect as a result of too many impact factors. This paper utilizes multi dimensional big dates of distributed PV projects to obtain the weight of factors influencing the ROI from the calculation equation of ROI, which is fitted with innovative big data mining method of LSSVM-PSO. Results show that construction cost, sunshine duration, retail electricity tariff and subsidy have the greatest impacts.

"A PID controller is an electrical element for reducing the error value between a desired setpoint and an actual measured process variable. The PID controller operates according to its input parameters, which need to be set before its run. The optimal values of these parameters must be found during the so-called tuning process. Today, this process can be automatized using stochastic, nature-inspired, population based algorithms, such as evolutionary and swarm intelligence-based algorithms. Unfortunately, these algorithms are too time consuming, and so the reactive, nature-inspired algorithms using a limited number of fitness function evaluations are proposed in this paper. Two reactive evolutionary algorithms (differential evolution and genetic algorithm), and four reactive, swarm intelligence-based algorithms (bat, hybrid bat, particle swarm optimization and cuckoo search), were used to tune the PID controller in our comparative study. Only ten individuals and ten iterations (generations) were used in order to select the most appropriate optimization algorithm for fast tuning of controller parameters. The results were compared using statistical analysis and showed that particle swarm optimization is the best option for such a task. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Acquiring relevant business concepts is a crucial first step for any software project for which the software experts are not domain experts. The wealth of information buried within an organization's written documentation is a precious source of concepts, relationships and attributes which can be used to model the enterprise's domain. The lack of targeted extraction tools can make perusing through this type of resource a lengthy and costly process. We propose a domain model focused extraction process aimed at the rapid discovery of knowledge relevant to the software expert. To avoid undesirable noise from high-level linguistic tools, the process is mainly composed of positive and negative base filters that are less error prone and more robust. The extracted candidates are then reordered using a weight propagation algorithm based on structural hints from source documents. When tested on French text corpora from public organizations, our process performs 2.7 times better than a statistical baseline for relevant concept discovery. A new metric to assess the performance discovery speed of relevant concepts is introduced. The annotation of a gold standard definition of software engineering oriented concepts for knowledge extraction tasks is also presented.

"A new process based on thermal-hydraulic conversion actuated by low-grade thermal energy is investigated. Input thermal energy can be provided by the means of solar collectors, as well as other low temperature energy sources. In the following article, ""thermo-hydraulic"" term refers to a process involving an incompressible fluid used as an intermediate medium to transfer work hydraulically between different thermal operated components or sub-systems. The system aims at providing trigeneration energy features for the residential sector, that is providing heating, cooling and electrical power for meeting the energy needs of domestic houses. This innovative system is made of two dithermal processes (working at two different levels of temperatures) and featuring two different working fluids. The first process is able to directly supply either electrical energy generated by an hydraulic turbine or drives the second process thanks to the incompressible fluid, which is similar to a heat pump effect for heating or cooling purposes. The innovative aspect of this process relies on the use of an hydraulic transfer fluid to transfer the work between each sub-system and therefore simplifying the conversion chain. A model, assuming steady-state operation, is developed to assess the energy performances of different variants of this thermo-hydraulic process with various heat source temperatures (80-110 degrees C) or heat sinks (0-30 degrees C), as well as various pairs of working fluids. For instance, in the frame of a single-family home, located in the Mediterranean region, the working fluid pairs (R1234yf/R1233zd) is investigated in detail in order to estimate the annual performances. For domestic houses, the process aims at amplifying the solar energy collected by a factor of 1.32 for heating purpose, provides a cold production with a coefficient of performance of 0.4 and generates electricity from the remaining solar energy with an efficiency of 3.7%, reducing the electrical or auxiliary consumption and overall greenhouse gas emissions.

"Address-resolution protocol (ARP) is an important protocol of data link layers that aims to obtain the corresponding relationship between Internet Protocol (IP) and Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. Traditional ARPs (address-resolution and neighbor-discovery protocols) do not consider the existence of malicious nodes, which reveals destination addresses in the resolution process. Thus, these traditional protocols allow malicious nodes to easily carry out attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attack and denial-of-service attack. To overcome these weaknesses, we propose an anonymous-address-resolution (AS-AR) protocol. AS-AR does not publicize the destination address in the address-resolution process and hides the IP and MAC addresses of the source node. The malicious node cannot obtain the addresses of the destination and the node which initiates the address resolution; thus, it cannot attack. Analyses and experiments show that AS-AR has a higher security level than existing security methods, such as secure-neighbor discovery.

"Analyzing retrieval accuracy and precision is an important element of space-based CO2 retrievals. However, this error analysis is sometimes challenging to perform rigorously because of the subtlety of Multivariate Statistics. To help address this issue, we revisit some fundamentals of Multivariate Statistics that help reveal the statistical essence of the associated error analysis. We show that the related statistical methodology is useful for revealing the intrinsic discrepancy and relation between the retrieval error for a nonzero-variate CO2 state and that for a zero-variate one. Our study suggests that the two scenarios essentially yield the same-magnitude accuracy, while the latter scenario yields a better precision than the former. We also use this methodology to obtain a rigorous framework systematically and explore a broadly used approximate framework for analyzing CO2 retrieval errors. The approximate framework introduces errors due to an essential, but often forgotten, fact that a priori climatology in reality is never equal to the true state. Due to the nature of the problem considered, realistic numerical simulations that produce synthetic spectra may be more appropriate than remote sensing data for our specific exploration. As highlighted in our retrieval simulations, utilizing the approximate framework may not be universally satisfactory in assessing the accuracy and precision of Xco(2) retrievals (with errors up to 0.17-0.28ppm and 1.4-1.7ppm, respectively, at SNR=400).

JapicCTI-142528). Patients aged 18-74 years were treated with bilastine 20 mg once daily for up to 52 weeks. Safety and tolerability were assessed on the basis of adverse events (AE), bilastine-related AE, laboratory tests and vital signs. Efficacy was assessed based on rash score, itch score, overall improvement and quality of life. One hundred and ninety-eight patients enrolled, 122 of whom (61.6%) completed the 52-week treatment period. AE were reported in 64.5% and bilastine-related AE in 2.5% of patients throughout the 52-week treatment period. All AE were mild to moderate in severity. AE associated with the nervous system occurred in 10 patients (5.1%) including seven patients (3.6%) with headache. Somnolence reported in two of these patients (1.0%) was related to bilastine. All efficacy variables improved during treatment with bilastine. In conclusion, long-term treatment with bilastine 20 mg once daily for 52 weeks is safe and well tolerated in Japanese patients with CSU or pruritus associated with skin diseases. Bilastine improved disease symptoms of both conditions early in treatment, and the efficacy was maintained throughout the treatment.

"A study on the thermal performance of the Tamar Suspension Bridge deck in Plymouth, UK, is presented in this paper. Ambient air, suspension cable, deck and truss temperatures were acquired using a wired sensor system. Deck extension data were acquired using a two-hop wireless sensor network. Empirical models relating the deck extension to various combinations of temperatures were derived and compared. The most accurate model, which used all the four temperature variables, predicted the deck extension with an accuracy of 99.4%. Time delays ranging from 10 to 66 min were identified between the daily cycles of the air temperature and of the structural temperatures and deck extension. However, accounting for these delays in the temperature-extension models did not improve the models' prediction accuracy. The results of this study suggest that bridge design recommendations are based on overly simplistic assumptions which could result in significant errors in the estimated deck movement, especially for temperature extremes. These findings aim to help engineers better understand the important aspect of thermal performance of steel bridges.

"A series elastic actuator (SEA) is a promising actuation method in force control applications that intelligently interacts with environments. The SEA is characterized by a spring placed between a load and an actuator, which is an electric motor in most cases. Since the spring plays the role of a transducer between position (i.e., the spring deflection) and force, it is able to control the output force (torque) precisely by utilizing typical position control methods. However, the force control performance of the SEA is considered to have limitations due to its elasticity, and thus, to be inferior to rigid actuators in terms of bandwidth. This paper proposes that the force control performance of the SEA can be improved by exploiting the dynamic model of the SEA. To this end, the SEA is modeled and analyzed utilizing the two-mass dynamic model, which is a well-known and widely accepted model of the flexible system. The disturbance observer and feedforward controller are introduced as the model-based control algorithms for the SEA to achieve the high-precision force control. In addition to high-bandwidth force control, the proposed controller can address the robust stability and performance against model parameter variance and exogenous disturbances. For the analytic and quantitative assessment of the proposed force control system, the dynamic characteristics of an SEA under various control algorithms are analyzed, and the experimental results are provided for an actual SEA system in this paper.

"A novel output-only subspace identification method is proposed to estimate the structural parameters of a shear-beam building under unknown ground excitation. The unique feature of the method is that both the structural parameters and the ground acceleration can be identified using only the absolute acceleration response, and no displacement and velocity responses are required. The method uses two subspace identification techniques sequentially and iteratively. The first technique extracts modal parameters of the building (natural frequencies, damping ratios, and mode shapes) using the absolute acceleration response and assumed or identified ground acceleration. These modal parameters further lead to the estimation of the building's structural parameters when the mass properties of the building are known. The second technique then estimates the ground acceleration using the absolute acceleration and the obtained structural parameters from the first technique. The two techniques are performed iteratively until the estimated structural parameters converge. A numerical example and a laboratory test are used to illustrate the proposed identification method. Results show that the estimation of structural parameters is fairly robust to the presence of measurement noise while the unknown ground acceleration is not in high frequency range. Factors influencing the performance of the technique are also studied and discussed.

The electrorefining process was carried out using LiCl-KCl-UCl3 molten salt as the electrolyte at 500 A degrees C under argon atmosphere. To protect the electrorefining vessel, made of 9Cr-1Mo steel from the attack by the electrolyte, yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) ceramic coating was deposited on 9Cr-1Mo steel by thermal spray process.

The results revealed that with increase in exposure time, the weight loss of uncoated 9Cr-1Mo steel samples increased, while YSZ coated 9Cr-1Mo steel samples exhibited insignificant weight loss.

"(2 + 1)-dimensional non-linear optical waves through the coherently excited resonant medium doped with the erbium atoms can be described by a (2 + 1)-dimensional non-linear Schrodinger equation coupled with the self-induced transparency equations. For such a system, via the Hirota method and symbolic computation, linear forms, one-, two-and N-soliton solutions are obtained. Asymptotic analysis is conducted and suggests that the interaction between the two solitons is elastic. Bright solitons are obtained for the fields E and P, while the dark ones for the field N, with E as the electric field, P as the polarization in the resonant medium induced by the electric field, and N as the population inversion profile of the dopant atoms.

"Ambient intelligence is an emerging platform that provides advances in sensors and sensor networks, pervasive computing, and artificial intelligence to capture the real time climate data. This result continuously generates several exabytes of unstructured sensor data and so it is often called big climate data. Nowadays, researchers are trying to use big climate data to monitor and predict the climate change and possible diseases. Traditional data processing techniques and tools are not capable of handling such huge amount of climate data. Hence, there is a need to develop advanced big data architecture for processing the real time climate data. The purpose of this paper is to propose a big data based surveillance system that analyzes spatial climate big data and performs continuous monitoring of correlation between climate change and Dengue. Proposed disease surveillance system has been implemented with the help of Apache Hadoop MapReduce and its supporting tools.

"A literature review has identified the absence of a robust framework that guides the development of streamlined and valid multiple linear regression (MLR) predictive models for construction engineering applications. A reliable MLR model requires an appropriate set of input variables that can satisfy the underlying assumptions of best linear unbiased estimators (BLUE). In this research, an analytical framework is proposed for developing MLR-based predictive models by (1) selecting input variables based on a modified stepwise approach, (2) verifying the BLUE assumptions, and (3) validating the prediction performance of the regression model. The resulting MLR model only contains the most-relevant input variables while also fulfilling the BLUE assumptions. By utilizing statistical inference techniques, the MLR model also produces reliable range estimates around its point-value prediction according to a particular confidence level. To illustrate the application procedure of the proposed framework, a data set intended for workability control of ready-mixed concrete from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository is used. A practical case study based on a real-world bridge construction project is provided to further demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology in modeling the precast span installation cycle-time.

"A method to visualize polytopes in a four-dimensional euclidian space (x, y, z, w) is proposed. A polytope is sliced by multiple hyperplanes that are parallel to each other and separated by uniform intervals. Since the hyperplanes are perpendicular to the w-axis, the resulting multiple slices appear in the three-dimensional (x, y, z) space and they are shown by the standard computer graphics. The polytope is rotated extrinsically in the four-dimensional space by means of a simple input method based on keyboard typings. The multiple slices are placed on a parabola curve in the three-dimensional world coordinates. The slices in a view window form an oval appearance. Both the simple and the double rotations in the four-dimensional space are applied to the polytope. All slices synchronously change their shapes when a rotation is applied to the polytope. The compact display in the oval of many slices with the help of quick rotations facilitate a grasp of the four-dimensional configuration of the polytope.

"A meminductor is a new type of memory device. It is of importance to study meminductor model and its application in nonlinear circuit prospectively. For this purpose, we present a novel mathematical model of meminductor, which considers the effects of internal state variable and therefore will be more consistent with future actual meminductor device. By using several operational amplifiers, multipliers, capacitors and resistors, the equivalent circuit of the model is designed for exploring its characteristics. This equivalent circuit can be employed to design meminductor-based application circuits as a meminductor emulator. By employing simulation experiment, we investigate the characteristics of this meminductor driven by sinusoidal excitation. The characteristic curves of current-flux (i-phi), voltage-flux (v-phi), v-rho (internal variable of meminductor) and phi-rho for the meminductor model are given by theoretical analyses and simulations. The curve of current-flux (i-phi) is a pinched hysteretic loop passing through the origin. The area bounding each sub-loop deforms as the frequency varies, and with the increase of frequency, the shape of the pinched hysteretic loop tends to be a straight line, indicating a dependence on frequency for the meminductor. Based on the meminductor model, a meminductive Wien-bridge chaotic oscillator is designed and analyzed. Some dynamical properties, including equilibrium points and the stability, bifurcation and Lyapunov exponent of the oscillator, are investigated in detail by theoretical analyses and simulations. By utilizing Lyapunov spectrum, bifurcation diagram and dynamical map, it is found that the system has periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic states. Furthermore, there exist some complicated nonlinear phenomena for the system, such as constant Lyapunov exponent spectrum and nonlinear amplitude modulation of chaotic signals. Moreover, we also find the nonlinear phenomena of coexisting bifurcation and coexisting attractors, including coexistence of two different chaotic attractors and coexistence of two different periodic attractors. The phenomenon shows that the state of this oscilator is highly sensitive to its initial valuse, not only for chaotic state but also for periodic state, which is called coexistent oscillation in this paper. The basic mechanism and potential applications of the existing attractors are illustrated, which can be used to generate robust pseudo random sequence, or multiplexed pseudo random sequence. Finally, by using the equivalent circuit of the proposed meminducive model, we realize an analog electronic circuit of the meminductive Wien-bridge chaotic system. The results of circuit experiment are displayed by the oscilloscope, which can verify the chaotic characteristics of the oscillator. The oscillator, as a pseudo random signal source, can be used to generate chaotic signals for the applications in chaotic cryptography and secret communications.

The inner control system is the existing control system based on a conventional PID controller, which is designed in advance and is independent of the outer control system. In order to improve tracking performance, the outer control system is designed based on optimal preview control theory and is added to the outside of the inner control system. A polynomial trajectory is used as the reference trajectory and is fed to the outer control system. The reference trajectory is modified online to minimize tracking error. The modified reference trajectory is derived as a control input signal from the outer control system and is fed to the inner control system.

"Agricultural diffuse water pollution remains a notable global pressure on water quality, posing risks to aquatic ecosystems, human health and water resources and as a result legislation has been introduced in many parts of the world to protect water bodies. Due to their efficiency and cost-effectiveness, water quality models have been increasingly applied to catchments as Decision Support Tools (DSTs) to identify mitigation options that can be introduced to reduce agricultural diffuse water pollution and improve water quality. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to the River Wensum catchment in eastern England with the aim of quantifying the long-term impacts of potential changes to agricultural management practices on river water quality. Calibration and validation were successfully performed at a daily time-step against observations of discharge, nitrate and total phosphorus obtained from high-frequency water quality monitoring within the Blackwater sub-catchment, covering an area of 19.6 km(2). A variety of mitigation options were identified and modelled, both singly and in combination, and their long-term effects on nitrate and total phosphorus losses were quantified together with the 95% uncertainty range of model predictions. Results showed that introducing a red clover cover crop to the crop rotation scheme applied within the catchment reduced nitrate losses by 19.6%. Buffer strips of 2 m and 6 m width represented the most effective options to reduce total phosphorus losses, achieving reductions of 12.2% and 16.9%, respectively. This is one of the first studies to quantify the impacts of agricultural mitigation options on long-term water quality for nitrate and total phosphorus at a daily resolution, in addition to providing an estimate of the uncertainties of those impacts. The results highlighted the need to consider multiple pollutants, the degree of uncertainty associated with model predictions and the risk of unintended pollutant impacts when evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation options, and showed that high-frequency water quality datasets can be applied to robustly calibrate water quality models, creating DSTs that are more effective and reliable.

"A cochlear implant (CI), also called a bionic ear or electronic cochlea, is an implantable electronic device that can partially restore hearing to profoundly deaf patients by directly stimulating the patient's auditory nerve via surgically implanted electrode arrays. Hearing impairment of the severely deaf patients translates into a 70-80 dB hearing loss, reaching a hearing dynamic range as low as 15-25 dB. As such, gain control systems are needed in CIs to map the acoustic input signal into the patient's hearing dynamic range. This paper proposes a programmable gain amplifier (PGA) which can be used to implement a dual-loop automated gain control (AGC). An analog signal processing technique is used, due to its advantages over the digital processing equivalents, such as potentially lower power consumption and higher processing speed. Programming the analog processing parameters, i.e. gain levels and time constants, is done by means of digital control words that set the values of corresponding bias currents. Computation of the control words is done in a digital fashion, allowing a hardware description language implementation of the gain control algorithm. This adds flexibility to the resulting gain control system: ability to choose between a feed-forward and feed-back topology, ability to choose between different compression functions: linear, logarithmic and power-law, and ability to set the desired compression limits Finally, a fully adaptive gain control system is implemented. The programmable aspect of the adaptive AGC implementation also enables the adjustment of the AGC operation to meet the patient's individual needs. Circuit simulation proves the functionality of the proposed PGA for automated gain control in CI applications.

"A self-sustaining sensor platform is a core component for Internet-of-Things and smart-grid systems. However, monitoring, processing, and displaying the minute changes of a targeted-environmental element in a real-time fashion without external power sources is challenging because of a practical difficulty of doing energy harvesting and analysis of dynamics at the same time. Here, we present a self-sustaining water-motion-sensing (SS-WMS) platform to monitor and display the time-varying dynamics of water-motion, i.e., frequency and amplitude, using only the energy harvested from the water-motion itself. A water-contact triboelectric nanogenerator (WC-TENG) produces electrical energy, correlated with the repetitive squeezing and releasing of a water droplet. The SS-WMS integrated circuit (IC) harvests the energy and simultaneously analyzes the dynamics of water-motion, which is converted into binary codes to be displayed through LEDs powered by the gathered energy. The proposed platform would contribute to advanced sensing functions of a self-sustaining system for various targeted-ambient elements.

"A magneto-rheological gel (MRG) is a kind of smart material fabricated by dispersing ferromagnetic particles in high viscosity polymer gel. The internal particles of MRG are uniformly dispersed under off-state. While with the precondition of an external applied magnetic field, the particles will form a reversible chain-like structure, in which process the electrical resistivity of MRG has an immense change. In order to deeply understand the changing mechanism of the magneto-resistance of MRG, a theoretical model based on both the magnetic-dipole behavior and the percolation theory was proposed in this work. This model incorporates the parameters of the magnetic field intensity and carbonyl iron powder (CIP) volume fraction. As a further effort to explore the magneto-resistance properties of MRG, a series of experimental testing were conducted. The magneto-resistance properties of MRG with different CIP volume fractions and under different magnetic fields were investigated. The experimental results indicated that the conductivity of MRG was significantly increased with the increasing magnetic field and CIP volume fraction. In addition, in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical model, the experimental measured results and theoretically obtained results were compared. The validation results demonstrated that the theoretical model proposed in this work is capable of reproducing the field-dependent magneto-resistance properties of MRG. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"A new joint mechanical and electrical simulation platform of a motion stage (reticle or wafer stage) was introduced of a step-and-scan lithography.

Because a state-space FE model has not only the stiff-body information but also that of the mechanical structure modals of a motion stage, hence when compared with a stiff-body model or a theoretic one it is much closer to an actual motion stage. A simulation example of a reticle stage control system was given of a step-and-scan lithography, in which the time and frequent performance indices were compared with both a stiff-body model and a state-space one respectively, and it further showed that the state-space model was much more adapted to meet the modeling requirements of an actual motion stage than that of a stiff-body one.

Muscle and coordination training are recommended to the patients as general measures. We inquired whether sling training is better than traditional physiotherapy in relieving pain and improving abilities of daily living. Fifty patients with osteoporosis were divided into two groups. Group A performed conventional physiotherapy, while Group B performed sling training exercises. Data were collected before and after the intervention and after 3 months. The registered parameters were stamina, posture, and pain. Posture, torques, and the associated strength of spinal muscles were studied in a biomechanical model in order to estimate the forces acting on the spine. Furthermore, the factors that exerted a positive impact on the success of therapy were registered. Forty-four patients (88%) completed the study. Positive effects of the training were noted in both groups, but significantly better effects were observed in the group that performed sling training. A reduction of pain independent of the number of fractures, significantly reduced torques, and reduced muscle strength were registered. Specific training programs helped to increase muscle strength and straightening the back thereby reducing the force needed on a permanent basis and decreasing torque in the spine. Sling training was more effective in that than traditional physiotherapy.

"1. How and at what spatial scale(s) animals change their movements in relation to their environment is central to several topics in ecology and conservation, including foraging ecology, habitat selection and dispersal. A method (first-passage time analysis, FPT) has recently been proposed to measure changes in movements through the landscape, as an index of search effort at the pertinent spatial scales. This method seems largely applicable to an increasing number of studies using satellite, radio-tracking or global positioning system (GPS), but its limits have not yet been assessed. 2. Here I used several movement simulations to examine the ability of FPT analysis to detect area-restricted search (ARS) according to different changes in movements, different patch structures and tracking accuracy. 3. FPT analysis was able to detect changes in movements when both speed and sinuosity changed, or when the animal reacted to patch boundaries. It was also able to detect ARS within the same path at several spatial scales in patches (nested or not) of different sizes. 4. Tracking accuracy affected the detection of ARS by FPT analysis. With the widely used Argos system, a minimum of 13 locations in effective ARS was necessary to detect this behaviour; seven when velocity filtering was applied. Similarly, spatial error in location affected the estimation of the ARS scale value, but the application of velocity filtering reduced this effect. 5. Comparisons between a real GPS track and pathways simulating the Argos error showed that the time-sampling rate of locations (due to satellite-pass frequency) decreased the probability of detecting ARS at small scales (50% across the whole range of scales. A velocity filter enabled significant reductions in this effect. 6. Synthesis and application. Within limits, FPT analysis is highly suitable for animal movement analysis, either to quantify habitat use, or to determine the scale most relevant for describing an ecological system or factors affecting movement decisions. In anticipation of increasing applications of FPT analysis in applied ecology, I provide recommendations for the use of the technique with several tracking methods.

"A subtype of microglia is defined by the morphological appearance of the cells as rod shaped. Little is known about this intriguing cell type, as there are only a few case reports describing rod-shaped microglia in the neuropathological literature. Rod-shaped microglia were shown recently to account for a substantial proportion of the microglia cells in the hippocampus of both demented and cognitively intact aged individuals. We hypothesized that aging could be a defining feature in the occurrence of rodshaped microglia. To test this hypothesis, 2 independent series of autopsy cases (total n 168 cases), which covered the adult lifespan from 20 to 100_ years old, were included in the study. The presence or absence of rod-shaped microglia was scored on IBA1 immunohistochemically stained slides for the hippocampus and cortex.

The bonding between the ZnO NWs and the polymer matrix was considered to be perfect and the linear piezoelectric behavior was assumed. It was shown that the electric potential has maximum and minimum values of opposite signs at the extreme ends along the nanowire length. The maximum generated electric potential varies from 0.01717 for a NW with an aspect ratio of one to 0.61107 for a NW with an aspect ratio of thirty. The optimum aspect ratio of ZnO NW was defined as the difference between the maximum generated electric potential at which the difference becomes less than 1%, which results in an aspect ratio of 16. The results are a major step toward producing ZnO NWs for nanocomposite electrical generators with maximum performance.

Thus, a new method namely Gaussian process based response surface for reliability analysis of suspension bridge was proposed. The research results show that the proposed method is feasible. The proposed method has advantages of high efficiency and excellent adaptability for reliability analysis of the complex structural such as suspension bridge.

"A damage localization algorithm based on Operational Deformed Shapes and known as Interpolation Damage Detection Method, is herein applied to the finite element model of a cable stayed bridge for detecting and localizing damages in the stays and the supporting steel beams under the bridge deck. Frequency Response Functions have been calculated basing on the responses of the bridge model to low intensity seismic excitations and used to recover the Operational Deformed Shapes both in the transversal and in the vertical direction. The analyses have been carried in the undamaged configuration and repeated in several different damaged configurations. Results show that the method is able to detect the damage and its correct location, provided an accurate estimation of the Operational Deformed Shapes is available. Furthermore, the damage detection algorithm results effective also when damages coexist at the same time at several location of the cable-stayed bridge members.

"A 12-kDa protein with redox-active dithiol in the active site -Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys-, human thioredoxin 1 (TRX) has demonstrated an excellent anti-inflammatory effect in various animal models. TRX is induced by various oxidative stress factors, including ultraviolet rays, radiation, oxidation, viral infections, ischemia reperfusion and anticancer agents, and are involved in the pathogenesis and progression of various diseases. We have demonstrated that systemic administration and transgenic overexpression of TRX is effective in a wide variety of in vivo inflammatory disease models, such as viral pneumonia, acute lung injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, indomethacin-induced gastric injury, and dermatitis. Our recent studies indicate that topically applied TRX prevents skin inflammation via the inhibition of local formation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. These indicate that the activation of inflammasome in skin and mucosa may be regulated by TRX. These suggest that application of TRX may be useful for the treatment of various skin and mucosal inflammatory disorders. Based on these results, we are conducting clinical studies to develop human recombinant thioredoxin 1 (rhTRX) pharmaceuticals. We have also developed substances that increase the expression of TRX in the body (TRX-inducing substances) in vegetables and other plant ingredients, and we are also developing skin-care products and functional foods that take advantage of the anti-inflammation and anti-allergic action of TRX.

"Agriculture intensification through the use of chemical nitrogen fertilizers is contributing substantially to the tremendous increases in global food production. However, eutrophication of downstream waters associated with excess nitrate pollutant runoff has become a major environmental concern in agricultural areas. Reservoirs used for irrigation are well-positioned to intercept substantial fertilizer runoff from upslope agricultural fields. The authors hypothesized that such reservoirs can be used to influence the quality of downstream surface water. A Markov decision process was formulated to find optimal operating policies for controlling stochastic agrochemical pollutant loads in reservoirs for irrigation. The model was applied to an irrigation reservoir in Japan that is prone to nitrate pollution from upslope green tea plantations. The computational results reveal that, in all nitrate-nitrogen states in which the reservoir storage state is below 10%, the optimal policy is to introduce cleaner water supplements from the upstream reservoir. When the reservoir storage volume exceeds 35% of active capacity and when the nitrate-nitrogen concentration is less than 3 mg/L, the optimal policy would be only to release the irrigation water. When the reservoir storage volume exceeds 35% of active capacity and when the nitrate nitrogen concentration exceeds 5 mg/L, the optimal operation decision is to first release irrigation water from the reservoir before introducing cleaner water supplements. Therefore, the operation of irrigation reservoirs can be optimized to control intercepted agro-fertilizer pollutants from intensive agricultural areas. The developed method for reservoir irrigation operation has the potential to support decision making processes to provide greater protection of the water environment from agrochemical pollution while sustaining the productivity in the intensive agricultural areas.

"A handover authentication protocol ensures secure and seamless roaming over multiple access points. A number of such protocols are proposed, but most of these protocols are inefficient or insecure. Very recently, Li et al. (Wireless Pers Commun 80(2):581-589, 2015) proposed a privacy-aware handover authentication protocol, and claimed their protocol to be more lightweight and secure than existing protocols. However, our analysis identifies that Li et al.'s protocol is insecure against access point impersonation attack. As a remedy, we proposed an improved protocol to fix the security weakness of Li et al.'s protocol. The improved protocol achieves the provable security in the random oracle model against the hardness assumptions of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem and elliptic curve computational Diffie-Hellman problem. The proposed handover authentication protocol is also formally analyzed with the automated tool ProVerif. The improved protocol not only enhances the security but is more lightweight than other related protocols.

"Activated microglia cells (MCs) are able to release a large amount of inflammatory cytokines after ischemic stroke, which exacerbates neuron damage. In this study, we explored the functional involvement of long non-coding RNA (IncRNA) SNHG14 and its potential regulatory mechanism in the activation of MCs. The mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and microglia cell model of oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) were made. The expression of SNHG14, miR-145-5p and PLA2G4A protein expression was determined by quantitative real time PCR and western blot, respectively. Dual-luciferase assay was used to verify the direct binding of miR-145-5p and PLA2G4A. Flow cytometry was applied to measure neurons' apoptosis. SNHG14 highly expressed in ischemic cerebral tissues and BV-2 cells after OGD treatment. SNHG14 knockdown could remarkably inhibit BV-2 cells activation induced by OGD; while SNHG14 overexpression significantly promoted BV-2 cells activation, showing an increase of TNF-alpha and NO production and neurons' apoptosis rate. Additionally, SNHG14 knockdown promoted the expression of miR-145-5p and reduced PLA2G4A. Contrarily, SNHG14 overexpression inhibited miR-145-5p expression and increased PLA2G4A. Moreover, miR-145-5p overexpression also reversed the effect of OGD on BV-2 cells activation. Bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase assay supported that SNHG14 could bind directly to miR-145-5p and miR-145-5pbinding site was existed on 3'-UTR of PLA2G4A. MiR-1455p mimic reversed the increase of PLA2G4A and reduced the high levels of TNF-a and NO in BV-2 cells induced by SNHG14 overexpression. SNHG14 increased the expression of PLA2G4A by inhibition of miR-145-5p, which resulted in the activation of MCs in cerebral infarction. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Accurate and timely traffic flow prediction is crucial to proactive traffic management and control in data driven intelligent transportation systems ((DITS)-I-2), which has attracted great research interest in the last few years. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Weighted K-Nearest Neighbor model, named STW-KNN, in a general MapReduce framework of distributed modeling on a Hadoop platform, to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of short-term traffic flow forecasting. More specifically, STW-KNN considers the spatial-temporal correlation and weight of traffic flow with trend adjustment features, to optimize the search mechanisms containing state vector, proximity measure, prediction function, and K selection. Furthermore, STW-KNN is implemented on a widely adopted Hadoop distributed computing platform with the MapReduce parallel processing paradigm, for parallel prediction of traffic flow in real time. Finally, with extensive experiments on real-world big taxi trajectory data, STW-KNN is compared with the state-of-the-art prediction models including conventional K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and C4.5. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to existing models on accuracy by decreasing the mean absolute percentage error (NAPE) value more than 11.59% only in time domain and even achieves 89.71% accuracy improvement with the MAPEs of between 3.34% and 6.00% in both space and time domains, and also significantly improves the efficiency and scalability of short-term traffic flow forecasting over existing approaches.

"A poster must be sufficiently informative to convey a suitable message which reflects the genuine characteristics of the topic. A social poster design deals with social issues, which are not instantaneous events where existing in a dynamic society. Therefore, the social poster design has to represent the continuous consequences due to the social incident. On 11 March in 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake hit off the east coast of Japan, caused 15,821 deaths, 3,962 missing, and 5,940 injuries in 20 Japanese prefectures as reported by The National Police Agency of Japan (Dunbar et al., 2011). Though the earthquake, aftershocks and tsunamis ended, it is an unfinished tragedy, due to the continuous exposure of the radioactive contaminated water by the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The highly contaminated water has accumulated on roofs and it keeps flowed into the Pacific Ocean when it rains (McCurry, 2015). This study aims to present the ongoing impact of radioactive materials to our society on a social poster through an animated graphic. The randomly created background patterns within the poster, symbolize the unfinished radioactive leaking and its circulation in our environment. Hence, this poster is a dynamically changing rather than a static graphic poster, much like the continuous changes occurring within the environment, due to the Fukushima event. In the middle, the red solid circle not only reflects the Japanese flag but also symbolizes the contaminated Earth. For the background patterns, I generated the random motion of oblique lines by computer programming using Processing, which is an open source programming language. The randomly generated graphic by Processing, referred to as animated graphic, exhibits the unexpected radioactive exposures due to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The red circle represented Japan and the Earth suffered by the ongoing contamination that it was depicted by transparent red that the symbol and the patterns are overlapped and coexist. It should be noted that the printed version of the poster is captured from the digital work, which can be found at https://dl. dropboxusercontent.com/s/ulcosh5 dpm1xw85/index. html? dl= 0 The animated graphic shown in the dynamic poster, informs an audience of the ongoing social issue that the radioactivity which has been leaking into the ocean since the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011.

"Acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AE-IPF) have been defined as events of clinically significant respiratory deterioration with an unidentifiable cause. They carry a significant mortality and morbidity and while their exact pathogenesis remains unclear, the possibility remains that hidden infection may play a role. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether changes in the respiratory microbiota occur during an AE-IPF. Bacterial DNA was extracted from bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with stable IPF and those experiencing an AE-IPF. A hyper-variable region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S rRNA) was amplified, quantified and pyrosequenced. Culture independent techniques demonstrate AE-IPF is associated with an increased BAL bacterial burden compared to stable disease and highlight shifts in the composition of the respiratory microbiota during an AE-IPF.

"A new secure key distribution scheme based on the dynamic chaos synchronization of two cascaded semiconductor laser systems (CSLSs) subject to common chaotic injection and random phase-modulated optical feedback is demonstrated. In this scheme, Alice and Bob adopt two independent random sequences to control the phase modulators of CSLSs, which induces a dynamic perturbation to the chaos synchronization. We thoroughly investigate the chaos synchronization performance under different phase-shift conditions with cross-correlation function, and systematically discuss the feasibility and security of the system. The results show that, with proper injection and feedback strength, the correlation coefficient gap between phase shift match and mismatch is clear and robust to the parameter mismatches in the CSLSs and those between the two CSLSs. Based on this, high-quality key distribution can be performed by picking out the identical random bits from the two independent random sequences according to the computational correlation. Moreover, the investigations on the information theoretic security and rate of the key distribution show that the security of the key distribution scheme can be further enhanced by properly increasing the number of layers in the CSLSs or employing highorder modulation format.

"As one of the main characteristics of seismic waves, apparent wave velocity has great influence on seismic responses of long-span suspension bridges. Understanding these influences is important for seismic design. In this article, the critical issues concerning the traveling wave effect analysis are first reviewed. Taizhou Bridge, the longest triple-tower suspension bridge in the world, is then taken as an example for this investigation. A three-dimensional finite element model of the bridge is established in ABAQUS, and the LANCZOS eigenvalue solver is employed to calculate the structural dynamic characteristics. Traveling wave effect on seismic responses of these long-span triple-tower suspension bridges is investigated. Envelopes of seismic shear force and moment in the longitudinal direction along the three towers, relative displacements between the towers and the girder, and reaction forces at the bottoms of the three towers under different apparent wave velocities are calculated and presented in detail. The results show that the effect of apparent wave velocity on the seismic responses of triple-tower suspension bridge fluctuates when the velocity is lower than 2000 m/s, and the effects turn stable when the velocity becomes larger. In addition, the effects of traveling wave are closely related to spectral characteristics and propagation direction of the seismic wave, and seismic responses of components closer to the source are relatively larger. Therefore, reliable estimation of the seismic input and apparent wave velocity according to the characteristics of the bridge site are significant for accurate prediction of seismic responses. This study provides critical reference for seismic analysis and design of long-span triple-tower suspension bridges.

"A gold nanoparticle probe-based assay (GNPA) was developed for ultrasensitive detection of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core antigen. In the GNPA, after anti-HCV core antigen polyclonal antibodies and single stranded barcode signal DNA were labeled on gold nanoparticle probe (NP), DNA enzyme was used to degrade the unbound barcode DNA5. The anti-HCV core antigen monoclonal antibodies were coated on magnetic microparticles probe (MMP). Then the NP-HCV core antigen-MMP sandwich immunocomplex was formed when the target antigen protein was added and captured. Magnetically separated, the immuno-complex containing the single-stranded barcode signal DNA was characterized by TagMan probe based real-time fluorescence PCR. A detection limit of 1 fg/ml was determined for the HCV core antigen which is magnitude greater than that of ELISA (2 ng/ml). The coefficients of variation (CV) of intra-assay and inter-assay respectively ranged from 0.22-2.62% and 1.92-3.01%.

"Adsorption processes are responsible for detection of cancer biomarkers in biosensors (and immunosensors), which can be captured with various principles of detection. In this study, we used a biosensor made with nanostructured films of polypyrrole and p53 antibodies, and image analysis of scanning electron microscopy data made it possible to correlate morphological changes of the biosensor with the concentration of cells containing the cancer biomarker p53. The selectivity of the biosensor was proven by distinguishing images obtained with exposure of the biosensor to cells containing the biomarker from those acquired with cells that did not contain it. Detection was confirmed with cyclic voltammetry measurements, while the adsorption of the p53 biomarker was probed with polarization-modulated infrared reflection absorption (PM-IRRAS) and a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). Adsorption is described using the Langmuir-Freundlich model, with saturation taking place at a concentration of 100 Ucells/mL. Taken together, our results point to novel ways to detect biomarkers or any type of analyte for which detection is based on adsorption as is the case of the majority of biosensors.

A simple, accurate, and robust quantitation method was developed based on gas chromatographic techniques (GC), which is suitable for routine analysis of residual PETRA monomers in these hydrogels. Unreacted PETRA was initially identified using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC MS). The quantitation of analyte was performed and validated using gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC FID). A linear relationship was obtained over the range of 0.0002%-0.0450% (m/m) with a correlation coefficient (r(2)) greater than 0.99. The recovery (>90%), intra-day precision (%RSD <0.67), inter-day precision (%RSD <2.5%), and robustness (%RSD <1.62%) of the method were within the acceptable values.

It is a fundamental process in different applications such as shape reconstruction in reverse engineering, 3D models retrieval, and CAD/CAM applications, etc. It consists of subdividing a polygonal surface into patches of uniform properties either from a geometrical point of view or from a perceptual/semantic point of view. In this paper, unsupervised clustering techniques for the 3D mesh segmentation problem are introduced. The K-means and the Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering techniques are selected for the development of the proposed clustering-based 3D mesh segmentation techniques. Since the mesh faces are considered the main element, the clustering technique is applied to the dual mesh. The 3D Euclidean distance is used as the distance measure to compute matching between mesh elements.

"Advancement in information technology is playing an increasing role in the use of information systems comprising relational databases. These databases are used effectively in collaborative environments for information extraction; consequently, they are vulnerable to security threats concerning ownership rights and data tampering. Watermarking is advocated to enforce ownership rights over shared relational data and for providing a means for tackling data tampering. When ownership rights are enforced using watermarking, the underlying data undergoes certain modifications; as a result of which, the data quality gets compromised. Reversible watermarking is employed to ensure data quality along-with data recovery. However, such techniques are usually not robust against malicious attacks and do not provide any mechanism to selectively watermark a particular attribute by taking into account its role in knowledge discovery. Therefore, reversible watermarking is required that ensures; (i) watermark encoding and decoding by accounting for the role of all the features in knowledge discovery; and, (ii) original data recovery in the presence of active malicious attacks. In this paper, a robust and semi-blind reversible watermarking (RRW) technique for numerical relational data has been proposed that addresses the above objectives. Experimental studies prove the effectiveness of RRW against malicious attacks and show that the proposed technique outperforms existing ones.

"A new approach for solar electricity generation and storage is proposed, based on the concept of thermally regenerative batteries. Concentrated sunlight is used for external thermo-chemical charging of a flow battery, and electricity is produced by conventional electro-chemical discharge of the battery. The battery replaces the steam turbine, currently used in commercial concentrated solar power (CSP) plants, potentially leading to much higher conversion efficiency. This approach offers potential performance, cost and operational advantages compared to existing solar technologies, and to existing storage solutions for management of an electrical grid with a significant contribution of intermittent solar electricity generation. Here we analyze the theoretical conversion efficiency for new thermo-electro-chemical storage (TECS) plant schemes based on the electro-chemical systems of sodium-sulfur (Na-S) and zinc-air. The thermodynamic upper limit of solar to electricity conversion efficiency for an ideal TECS cycle is about 60% for Na-S at reactor temperature of 1550 K, and 65% for the zinc-air system at 1750 K, both under sunlight concentration of 3000. A hybrid process with carbothermic reduction in the zinc-air system reaches 60% theoretical efficiency at the more practical conditions of reaction temperature <1200 K and concentration <1000. Practical TECS plant efficiency, estimated from these upper limits, may then be much higher compared to existing solar electricity technologies.

Overall, 117 laparoscopic (78%) and 34 open STCs were performed, with a conversion rate of 14.5%. Mortality and morbidity rates were 0.7% and 38%, respectively. Whilst operative time was shorter for open STC (by 75 min; P = 0.001), there were fewer complications (32% vs 62%; P = 0.002) and a shorter hospital stay (by 6.9 days; P = 0.0002) following laparoscopic STC. Fewer complications and shorter hospital stay were also observed after elective STC. Patients undergoing laparoscopic STC were more likely to undergo a restorative second-stage procedure than those having open STC (75% vs 50%; P = 0.03). Conclusion Laparoscopic STC for UC is feasible and safe, even in the emergency situation. A laparoscopic approach may offer advantages in terms of lower morbidity and reduced length of stay. Elective resection may offer similar advantages and is best performed whenever possible.

"A growing number of reports have demonstrated that the widely-used herbicide Atrazine (ATR) can cause injury to dopamine (DA) neurons, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of lactational ATR exposure in Sprague-Dawley rats on dopaminergic neuron health later in life. Compared with control rats, rats exposed to ATR during a critical period of neural development showed decreased striatal DA content and increased rates of DA turnover. The expression of Monoamine oxidase (MAO), which is associated with DA degradation, was up-regulated, and the expression of Vesicular Monoamine Transporter 2 (VMAT2), which is associated with DA transport, was down-regulated. The expression of transcription factor Nuclear Receptor Related Factor 1 (Nurr1), which is associated with DA neuron development, was down-regulated. Increased age (6-12 months old) increased the statistical significance of the differences of the above indicators in the ATR-treated rats compared to the control rats (P < 0.05). Taken together, our results indicate that ATR exposure during the critical neural development period causes a down-regulation of Nurr1, which in turn affects Nurr1 target genes, including MAO, VMAT2 and DAT, which are involved in DA degradation and transport. Reduced expression of these genes impairs the capacity for vesicular storage or reuptake of DA, causing decreased levels of striatal DA, which can ultimately lead to DA neuron injury. DA neuron injuries become more severe over time, which suggests that aging can synergistically promote the ATR-associated DA neuron injuries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"A lot of work has taken place into the design and control of DC-DC converters, and various methodologies have been proposed. While traditionally only P or PI controllers have been employed, recent applications that require a fast transient performance impose the usage of the derivative, D, term. As it is well known, using the D-term can cause numerous problems in such converters that greatly downgrade their performance and lifetime. Having said that, in this paper, we first prove that by using the D-term, it is possible to increase the stability margin (and hence keep a low current ripple), and then, we present a novel method to tune the PID controller that guarantees a fast and stable response over a wide range of parameter values without using an unreasonably high value of the derivative gain that magnifies the presence of noise in the system. The controller is designed utilising Filippov's method, and a simple and easy to implement strategy is proposed. Furthermore, an adaptive PID controller is designed whose gains are changed depending on the value of the supply voltage or output load. Another important contribution of this work is the derivation of the saltation matrix when the switching manifold is discontinuous, the complete proof is presented, and the results validated.

The proposed metasurface is composed of carefully arranged unit cells with spatially varied dimension, which can diffuse reflection uniformly and avoid the reflection in the specular direction. A proposed metasurface sample is fabricated and tested to validate RCS reduction behavior predicted by full-wave simulation software ANSYS HFSS. A more than 10 dB RCS reduction within the entire X-band is observed, indicating our metasurface may be potentially applied to future stealth technology.

"A pi-conjugated microporous poly(benzothiadiazole) (hereafter denoted as BBT) is synthesized through palladium-catalyzed Sonogashira-Hagihara cross-coupling polycondensation, and used as a novel organic semiconductor photocatalyst for both photocatalytic H-2 production and pollutant degradation under visible light (lambda >420 nm) irradiation. Furthermore, BBT/TiO2 heterojunction is conveniently fabricated through an in-situ polycondensation procedure of 4,7-dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole and 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene in the presence of commercial TiO2. After optimizing the composition ratio, the resultant BBT/TiO2 heterojunction exhibited dramatically enhanced visible-light-responsive photocatalytic activities (similar to 18.0 and 20.4 times higher activity for H2 evolution and ciprofloxacin degradation, respectively) as compared BBT alone. Detailed investigations revealed that the BBT/TiO2 heterojunction interface can accelerate the photogenerated electron transferring from BBT to TiO2, and then improve the photoactivity. The present work exhibits some interesting points and dramatic improvement of photoactivity when an organic semiconductor is combined with an inorganic one, which provides a novel direction to exploit and fabricate photocatalyst for solar energy conversion and pollutant degradation.

"Aberrations of gene methylation in stool DNA (sDNA) is an effective biomarker for non-invasive colorectal cancer diagnosis. However, it is challenging to accurately quantitate the gene methylation levels in sDNA due to the low abundance and degradation of sDNA. In this study, a digital quantification strategy was proposed by combining emulsion PCR (emPCR) with hydrogel immobilized bead-array. The assay includes following steps: bisulfite conversion of sDNA, pre-amplification by PCR with specific primers containing 5 ' universal sequences, emPCR of pre-amplicons with beaded primers to achieve single-molecular amplification and identification of hydrogel embedding beads coated with amplicons. The sensitivity and the specificity of the method are high enough to pick up 0.05% methylated targets from unmethylated DNA background. The successful detection of hypermethylated vimentin gene in clinical stool samples suggests that the proposed method should be a potential tool for non-invasive colorectal cancer screening.

"Analysis and detection of human behaviors from video sequences has became recently a very hot research topic in computer vision and artificial intelligence. Indeed, human behavior understanding plays a fundamental role in several innovative application domains such as smart video surveillance, ambient intelligence and content-based video information retrieval. However, the uncertainty and vagueness that typically characterize human daily activities make frameworks for human behavior analysis (HBA) hard to design and develop. In order to bridge this gap, this paper proposes a hierarchical architecture, based on a tracking algorithm, time-delay neural networks and fuzzy inference systems, aimed at improving the performance of current MBA systems in terms of scalability, robustness and effectiveness in behavior detection. Precisely, the joint use of the aforementioned methodologies enables both a quantitative and qualitative behavioral analysis that efficiently face the intrinsic people/objects tracking imprecision and provide context aware and semantic capabilities for better identifying a given activity. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed framework have been verified by using the well-known CAVIAR dataset and comparing our system's performance with other similar approaches working on the same dataset.

"A novel variational Bayesian mixture of experts model for robust regression of bifurcating and piece-wise continuous processes is introduced. The mixture of experts model is a powerful model which probabilistically splits the input space allowing different models to operate in the separate regions. However, current methods have no fail-safe against outliers. In this paper, a robust mixture of experts model is proposed which consists of Student-t mixture models at the gates and Student-t distributed experts, trained via Bayesian inference. The Student-t distribution has heavier tails than the Gaussian distribution, and so it is more robust to outliers, noise and non normality in the data. Using both simulated data and real data obtained from the Z24 bridge this robust mixture of experts performs better than its Gaussian counterpart when outliers are present. In particular, it provides robustness to outliers in two forms: unbiased parameter regression models, and robustness to overfitting/complex models.

"A prospective, single-arm study of 50 participants evaluated an extended INR follow-up interval to determine the implementation feasibility and safety of an extended interval in Veterans on a stable dose of warfarin. A protocol was designed to allow for a rigorous, yet pragmatic evaluation of a 12-week INR follow-up interval. Feasibility was determined by study enrollment, retention, and participant achievement rates for the extended INR interval. Safety was determined by bleeding and thromboembolism rates. Participants were monitored for 6 months. Despite the long-term stability of participants prior to enrollment, only 56% achieved a 12-week follow-up interval and only 34% of enrolled participants maintained a 12-week interval. Sixteen percent of participants were never eligible for an extension of their INR follow-up interval despite meeting initial enrollment criteria. There were two major bleeding events and one participant who experienced a thromboembolic event. Implementation of an extended interval of INR follow-up appears feasible as participant enrollment goals were met and pharmacists were able to follow the study protocol. However, a lower than expected proportion of participants were able to achieve and maintain an extended INR follow-up interval. Future evaluations are needed to confirm the safety of an extended INR interval.

"Across all kingdoms in the tree of life, calcium (Ca2+) is an essential element used by cells to respond and adapt to constantly changing environments. In multicellular organisms, it plays fundamental roles during fertilization, development and adulthood. The inability of cells to regulate Ca2+ can lead to pathological conditions that ultimately culminate in cell death. One such pathological condition is manifested in Parkinson's disease, the second most common neurological disorder in humans, which is characterized by the aggregation of the protein, alpha-synuclein. This Review discusses current evidence that implicates Ca2+ in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Understanding the mechanisms by which Ca2+ signaling contributes to the progression of this disease will be crucial for the development of effective therapies to combat this devastating neurological condition.

In order to establish credit profiles, there is a need to get information (e.g. spending patterns) from the consumers and from the companies that are selling related goods. The problem is how to share private information about customers and companies without compromising the secrecy and confidentiality of such information. In this work, we propose a cryptographic protocol to share sensitive information while preserving the privacy of the customer as well as the information of the commercial institution. Furthermore, we analyse the proposed protocol by using Petri nets to verify the absence of livelocks, deadlocks, and other anomalies in the protocol.

"A fuzzy algorithm, the Takagi-Sugeno model, is implemented to develop a fuzzy inference system for predicting the holding capacity of suction caisson foundations for offshore platforms. The premise parameters of the fuzzy model are optimized by using a subtractive clustering algorithm. The consequent parameters are optimally determined via a weighted least square estimation. The input variables used for training the fuzzy model include the aspect ratio of the caisson, the undrained shear strength of the clay, and the angle that the chain force forms with the horizontal. The output of the proposed fuzzy model is the capacity of the suction caisson anchor. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the fuzzy modeling framework, the results of extensive finite element analyses are investigated. Comparisons of the trained fuzzy model with the data demonstrate that the proposed modeling framework is an effective method to estimate the holding capacity of offshore suction caisson systems. Moreover, the performance of the fuzzy model is robust against higher levels of input data uncertainties. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

"Applying pesticides to crops is one of the causes of water pollution by surface runoff, and chlorpyrifos, trifluralin and chlorothalonil are used respectively as insecticide, herbicide and fungicide for crop plants widely. To explore effects of three pesticides on aquatic organisms, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities were determined after 24 h and 48 h exposure of D. magna with ages of 6-24 h to several low concentrations of chlorpyrifos (0.36, 0.72, 1.43, 2.86, 5.72 mu g.L-1), trifluralin (0.17, 0.33, 0.66, 1.33, 2.65 mg.L-1) and chlorothalonil (0.09, 0.18, 0.36, 0.72, 1.43 mg.L-1) respectively. Main reproductive parameters including first pregnancy time, first brood time, the number of first brood and total fecundity after 21 d exposures at the same concentrations of pesticides as described above were also measured. The results showed that the activities of GST increased in lower concentrations and decreased in higher concentrations after 24 h exposure to three pesticides, respectively. The activities of SOD showed the same changes after 48 h exposure. With the time prolonged, the activities of GST decreased while the activities of SOD increased. After 21 d exposure, the first pregnancy time and first brood time were delayed, while the number of the first brood and total fecundity per female decreased with increasing concentrations. These results corroborated that GST activity was more sensitive to those pesticides than SOD activity, and there was a significant relationship between total fecundity and pesticides-dose(r>0.94, n=6), GST activity after 48 h exposure and total fecundity after 21 d exposure (r>0.92, n=6).

Using a modified Posner cueing paradigm, we replicate the previous findings of gender differences in the gaze-cueing effect whereby female but not male participants responded significantly faster to validly cued than to invalidly cued targets. In contrast to the previous studies, we report a robust cueing effect for both male and female participants when head turning direction was used as the central cue, whereas oriented bodies proved ineffectual as cues to attention for both males and females. These results are discussed with reference to the time course of central cueing effects, gender differences in spatial attention, and current models of how cues from the human body are combined to judge another person's direction of attention.

"A magnetorheological elastomer (MRE) is a smart material that has a reversible and variable modulus in a magnetic field. Natural rubber, which has better physical properties than silicone matrices, was used as a matrix in the fabrication of the MREs used in this study. Carbonyl iron powder (CIP), which has a rapid magnetic reaction, was selected as a magnetic material to generate the magnetic-field-dependent modulus in the MREs. The MRE specimens were cured in an anisotropic mold, which could be used to induce a uniaxial magnetic field via permanent magnets, to control the orientation of the CIP, and the shear modulus of the MREs was evaluated under a magnetic field induced by using a magnetic flux generator (MFG). Because the use of a conventional evaluation system to determine the magnetic-field-dependent shear modulus of the MREs was difficult, an evaluation system based on single degree-of-freedom vibration and electromagnetics that included an MFG, which is a device that generates a magnetic field via a variable induced current, was designed. An electromagnetic finite element method (FEM) analysis and design of experiments (DoE) techniques were employed to optimize the magnetic flux density generated by the MFG. The optimized system was verified over the range to determine the magnetic flux density generated by the MFG in order to use a magnetic circuit analysis to identify the existence of magnetic saturation. A variation in the shear modulus was observed with increasing CIP volume fraction and induced current. The experimental results revealed that the maximum variation in the shear modulus was 76.3% for 40 vol% CIP at an induced current of 4 A. With these results, the appropriate CIP volume fraction, induced current, and design procedure of the MFG can be proposed as guidelines for applications of MREs based on natural rubber.

"A Pelton-wheel impulse turbine is a hydro mechanical energy conversion device which converts gravitational energy of elevated water into mechanical work. This mechanical work is converted into electrical energy by means of running an electrical generator The kinetic energy of the Water-jet is directed tangentially at the buckets of a Pelton-wheel. The Water-jet strikes on each bucket's convex profile splitter and get split into two halves. Each half is turned backwards, almost through 180 degrees relative to the bucket on a horizontal plane. Practically this angle may vary between 165 degrees to 170 degrees. Normally all the jet energy is used in propelling the rim of the bucket wheel. Invariably some jet water misses the bucket and posses onto the tail race without doing any useful work. This hydro, device is a good source of hydro-electrical energy conversion for a high water head. The present work in this research paper deals with some advanced modifications in the conventional Pelton-wheel so that it can be used for low-head and heavy-discharge applications. Both kinetic and potential energy of the water source is consumed by the runner wheel. Considerable gravitational effect of the water jet is exploited by means of some modifications in a conventional Pelton-wheel.

"A Shannon cipher system for memoryless sources in which distortion is allowed at the legitimate decoder is considered. The source is compressed using a secured rate distortion code, which satisfies a constraint on the compression rate, as well as a constraint on the exponential rate of the excess-distortion probability at the legitimate decoder. Secrecy is measured by the exponential rate of the exiguous-distortion probability at the eavesdropper, rather than by the traditional measure of equivocation. The perfect-secrecy exponent is defined as the maximal exiguous-distortion exponent achievable when the key rate is unlimited. The reproduction-based estimate exponent is defined as the maximal exiguous-distortion exponent achievable for a genie-aided eavesdropper, which knows the secret key. Under limited key rate, it is proved that the maximal achievable exiguous-distortion exponent is equal to the minimum between the key rate plus the reproduction-based estimate exponent, and the perfect-secrecy exponent. The result is generalized to a fairly general class of variable key-rate and coding-rate codes.

Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), HR and ECG were recorded. HR was mildly increased while SBP and DBP were mildly decreased after Dipyridamole infusion. There was only statistically significant difference between ECG changes as well as transient ischemic dilation (TID) ratio between normal scans and scans with ischemia (P = 0.02 and P = 0.01 respectively). There was correlation between these variables and summed stress score (SSS) and summed difference score (SDS). Patients with ischemia in their scans, 44.3% had ST depression after Dipyridamole infusion. Also ST depression most frequently was seen in patients with left anterior descending artery disease. From patients with abnormal scan + ST depression after Dipyridamole infusion (33 patient), 27 patient (81.81%) had ischemia. There was an association between TID ratio as well as ECG changes after Dipyridamole infusion and SSS, SDS and coronary artery territory abnormality. Difference between calculated left ventricular ejection fraction using stress and rest images had significant correlation with SSS and SDS. ST depression after Dipyridamole infusion and TID ratio had association with ischemia, SSS and SDS. So in equivocal Gated SPECT findings, they could be very useful for interpretation.

"A novel dual Halbach array is proposed in this paper to increase the output performance of tubular linear machines. The magnetic field distribution in three-dimensional (3D) space is formulated with Bessel functions analytically. Following that, the modeling of force output for linear machines with three-phase windings is carried out based on Lorentz force law. The formula component of force ripple is separated from the analytical expression of total force. It is found that for multi-phase tubular linear machines, the force output and force ripple are not only closely related to the instantaneous position of the mover, but also the starting position. Therefore, the force output of the linear machine is formulated for three typical starting positions as a function of mover positions. The derived models are simulated with respect to the mover's motion. They are also validated with numerical results from finite element calculation. The study shows that an appropriate starting position of the mover helps to improve the output performance of the tubular linear machines. The proposed analytical force model can also be employed to analyze the influence of the structure parameters on the force output of linear machines with similar structures.

"Accurate and high resolution bathymetric data is a necessity for a wide range of coastal oceanographic research topics. Active sensing methods, such as ship-based soundings and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), are expensive and time consuming solutions. Therefore, the significance of Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) has increased in the last ten years due to the availability of multi-constellation, multi-temporal, and multi-resolution remote sensing data as Open Data. Effective SDB algorithms have been proposed by many authors, but there is no ready-to-use software module available in the Geographical Information System (GIS) environment as yet. Hence, this study implements a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) based SDB workflow as a Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) GIS module (i.image.bathymetry). Several case studies were carried out to examine the performance of the module in multi-constellation and multi-resolution satellite imageries for different study areas. The results indicate a strong correlation between SDB and reference depth. For instance, case study 1 (Puerto Rico, Northeastern Caribbean Sea) has shown an coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.98 and an Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.61 m, case study 2 (Iwate, Japan) has shown an R-2 of 0.94 and an RMSE of 1.50 m, and case study 3 (Miyagi, Japan) has shown an R-2 of 0.93 and an RMSE of 1.65 m. The reference depths were acquired by using LiDAR for case study 1 and an echo-sounder for case studies 2 and 3. Further, the estimated SDB has been used as one of the inputs for the Australian National University and Geoscience Australia (ANUGA) tsunami simulation model. The tsunami simulation results also show close agreement with post-tsunami survey data.

METHODS Multiple MRI techniques were used to assess cerebral changes in 20 quiescent CD patients with fatigue (defined with at least 6 points out of an 11-point numeric rating scale compared with 17 healthy age and gender matched controls without fatigue. Furthermore, mental status was assessed by cognitive functioning, based on the neuropsychological inventory including the different domains global cognitive functioning, memory and executive functioning and in addition mood and quality of life scores. Cognitive functioning and mood status were correlated with MRI findings in the both study groups. RESULTS Reduced glutamate + glutamine (Glx = Glu + Gln) concentrations (P = 0.02) and ratios to total creatine (P = 0.02) were found in CD patients compared with controls. Significant increased Cerebral Blood Flow (P = 0.05) was found in CD patients (53.08 +/- 6.14 mL/100 g/min) compared with controls (47.60 +/- 8.62 mL/100 g/min). CD patients encountered significantly more depressive symptoms (P < 0.001). Cognitive functioning scores related to memory (P = 0.007) and executive functioning (P = 0.02) were lower in CD patients and both scores showed correlation with depression and anxiety. No correlation was found subcortical volumes between CD patients and controls in the T1-weighted analysis. In addition, no correlation was found between mental status and MRI findings.

"3D finite-element (FE) mesh generation is a major hurdle for marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) modeling. In this paper, we present a FE discretization operator (FEDO) that automatically converts a 3D finite difference (FD) model into reliable and efficient tetrahedral FE meshes for CSEM modeling. FEDO sets up wireframes of a background seabed model that precisely honors the seafloor topography. The wireframes are then partitioned into multiple regions. Outer regions of the wireframes are discretized with coarse tetrahedral elements whose maximum size is as large as a skin depth of the regions. We demonstrate that such coarse meshes can produce accurate FE solutions because numerical dispersion errors of tetrahedral meshes do not accumulate but oscillates. In contrast, central regions of the wireframes are discretized with fine tetrahedral elements to describe complex geology in detail. The conductivity distribution is mapped from FD to FE meshes in a volume-averaged sense. To avoid excessive mesh refinement around receivers, we introduce an effective receiver size. Major advantages of FEDO are summarized as follow. First, FEDO automatically generates reliable and economic tetrahedral FE meshes without adaptive meshing or interactive CAD workflows. Second, FEDO produces FE meshes that precisely honor the boundaries of the seafloor topography. Third, FEDO derives multiple sets of FE meshes from a given FD model. Each FE mesh is optimized for a different set of sources and receivers and is fed to a subgroup of processors on a parallel computer. This divide and conquer approach improves the parallel scalability of the FE solution. Both accuracy and effectiveness of FEDO are demonstrated with various CSEM examples.

As an important prerequisite, optimal model based experiment design ensures proper excitation of the system dynamics while the desired SoC operating range is covered. For SoC estimation, an augmented state space representation of the LMN is derived and the nonlinear observer design is presented. In particular, the use of a fuzzy observer is beneficial in combination with LMNs since the local observers are time-invariant which greatly reduces the complexity of the global estimator. The proposed concepts are validated experimentally by means of a Lithium Ion power cell. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"A 60-year-old man presented with an 18-month history of gradually worsening cough and a 12-month history of dyspnea on exertion. High-resolution computed tomography showed bilateral uniform ground grass opacity in the lower lung fields, partially resolved by smoking cessation. A tentative diagnosis of desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) was made. Video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed and pathological analysis showed peribronchiolar fibrosis with intra-alveolar macrophage infiltration. Elemental analysis detected aluminum and iron in the upper lobe and only iron in the lower lobe. Thus, a definitive diagnosis of mixed dust pneumoconiosis with DIP-like reaction was made. DIP-like reaction is known to be a reactive change caused by exposure to tobacco smoke as well as by inhalation of inorganic particles. Obtaining a detailed medical history including occupational and environmental risk factors is important to distinguish cases of DIP-like reaction due to exposure to inorganic particles from the usual cases related to smoking, and thus provide suitable treatment.

"An effective method based on measuring the fiber orientation of yarn floats with two-dimensional Fourier transform (2-D FFT) is proposed to recognize the weave pattern of yarn-dyed fabric in the high-resolution image. The recognition process consists of four main steps: 1. High-resolution image reduction, 2.Fabric image skew correction, 3.Yarn floats localization, 4. Yarn floats classification. Firstly, the high-resolution image is reduced by the nearest interpolation algorithm. Secondly, the skew of the fabric image is corrected based on Hough transform. Thirdly, the yarn floats in the fabric image is localized by the yarns segmentation method based on the mathematical statistics of sub-images. Fourthly, the high-resolution image is corrected and its yarns are segmented successively according to the inspection information of the reduced image. The fiber orientations are detected by 2-D FFT, and the yarn floats are classified by k-means clustering algorithm. Experimental results and discussions demonstrate that, by measuring the fiber orientation of yarn floats, the proposed method is effective to recognize the yarn floats and the weave pattern for yarn-dyed, solid color, and gray fabrics.

"A study was conducted to determine the financial and environmental effects of water quality on rainwater harvesting systems. The potential for replacing tap water used in washing machines with rainwater was studied, and then analysis presented in this paper is valid for applications that include washing machines where tap water hardness may be important A wide range of weather conditions, such as rainfall (284-1794 mm/year); water hardness (14-315 mg/L CaCO3); tap water prices (0.85-2.65 Euros/m(3)) in different Spanish urban areas (from individual buildings to whole neighbourhoods); and other scenarios (including materials and water storage capacity) were analysed. Rainfall was essential for rainwater harvesting, but the tap water prices and the water hardness were the main factors for consideration in the financial and the environmental analyses, respectively. The local tap water hardness and prices can cause greater financial and environmental impacts than the type of material used for the water storage tank or the volume of the tank. The use of rainwater as a substitute for hard water in washing machines favours financial analysis. Although tap water hardness significantly affects the financial analysis, the greatest effect was found in the environmental analysis. When hard tap water needed to be replaced, it was found that a water price of 1 Euro/m(3) could render the use of rainwater financially feasible when using large-scale rainwater harvesting systems. When the water hardness was greater than 300 mg/L CaCO3, a financial analysis revealed that an net present value greater than 270 Euros/dwelling could be obtained at the neighbourhood scale, and there could be a reduction in the Global Warming Potential (100 years) ranging between 35 and 101 kg CO2 eq./dwelling/year.

"A pitch and surge coupled dynamic model of a high-speed craft is not available for dynamic trim control applications in the literature. The existing fluid-structure interaction models of a high-speed craft are not adequate for simulations and control applications, since they require a great deal of computation time, for example more than 20-40 s depending on a vessel particulars. Hence, in this work, we aimed to obtain a dynamic model of a high-speed craft for surge and pitch motions. Then the obtained model will be utilized to design an automatic controller which adjust the command signal on a high-speed craft to increase fuel efficiency, safety and comfort of passengers in a vessel. The coupled pitch and surge motion of a high-speed craft with trim tabs/interceptors was modelled by using full scale sea trial data. The linear parametric modelling using System Identification (SI) Methods and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modelling were carried out and the comparisons of both the training and validation results are given. High correlation coefficients and low average values of absolute errors in surge and pitch dynamics were obtained by using ANN Method. The ANN model can be improved for further control designs on a marine vessel's operations.

"Ambient noise variability is a critical challenge encountered by multiple stakeholders, including sonar designers and operators. Among the sources of ambient noise in the ocean, wind related noise has significant impact on sonar performance. The tropical waters in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), present random fluctuations in the surface parameters, namely the wind speed, surface temperature, wave height, etc. resulting in variations in the ambient noise characteristics. The site-specific surface fluctuations in the tropical regions restrict the possibility of generalized algorithm design to mitigate the ambient noise impact. The work attempts to study the variations in the ambient noise levels corresponding to the fluctuations in the surface parameters. The site-specific behavior of the tropical IOR is demonstrated using surface data available from moored buoy at three distinct locations of the IOR. The analysis methodology can be used to characterize, predict and improve sonar performance, particularly in severe conditions of the tropical IOR.

"A sustainable strategy for conjunctive water management must include information on the temporal and spatial availability of this natural resource. Because of water shortages in the dry seasons, farmers on the Upper Plain of the Chao Phraya River basin, Thailand, are increasingly using groundwater to meet their irrigation needs. To evaluate the possibilities of conjunctive water management in the area, the spatial-temporal changes in the water table of the Younger Terrace Aquifer were investigated. First, a regional geomorphological map based on field surveys, remote sensing and previous environmental studies was developed. Then, the well data were analyzed in relation to rainfall, streamflow, yield and pumpage, and the data were interpolated using geostatistical techniques. The results were analyzed via integrated zoning based on color theory as applied to multivariate visualization. The analysis results indicate areas that would be more suitable for groundwater extraction in a conjunctive management framework with regard to the natural hydrogeological processes and the effects of human interaction. The kriging results were compared with the geomorphological map, and the geomorphological areas exhibit distinct hydrogeological patterns. The western fans exhibit the best potential for the expansion of conjunctive use, whereas the borders of the northern fans exhibit the lowest potential.

"A significant energy loss results from the poor thermal insulations of the commercial and public buildings. Windows diffuse a large fraction of building heating and cooling energy to the external environment, representing an annual impact of 4.1 quadrillion British thermal unit of primary energy in the US. The current technology for efficient windows relies upon the double-pane insulated glass unit with an insulating gas in between. A key challenge is to reduce thermal conductivity of the windows without relying on insulating materials. The photothermal effect can be possibly utilized for particular functionalities that can collect solar energy for reducing heat loss. The insulation efficiency is quantified through the U-factor, defined as the ratio of the heat flux (H) per unit area through the pane to the difference (Delta T) between the window interior surface and exterior temperatures. Upon solar irradiation, single-panes can ""self-heat"" via the photothermal effect from the nanoparticle coatings. This can effectively reduce Delta T for enhanced thermal insulation. In this study, the photothermal effect on Fe3O4 nanoparticles stimulated by solar light was investigated for nanoparticles in solutions and as thin films for energy-efficient windows. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles were surface-functionalized with different polymers to modulate colloidal stability and for the investigation of the photothermal effect. The photothermal heating efficiencies of Fe3O4 with different surface coatings were found to be much greater under the white-light irradiation than near infrared (NIR) in both aqueous suspension and as thin films. The mechanism for the photothermal effect of Fe3O4 was identified in terms of its band structure. Both Urbach energy and band gap were obtained based on absorption spectra of various Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The Urbach ""tail"" was found consistent with nanoparticle surface defect structures, while the band gap (similar to 3.1 eV) corresponded to the electronic transitions in the octahedral site of Fe3O4. We also discuss the absorption based photonic physics responsible for the much-enhanced photothermal heating by white-light as compared with NIR. Based on the photothermal heating, the U-factors were obtained with the nanoparticle coatings that show promise in producing energy efficient windows.

"A beta peptides, the main protein components of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plaques, derive from a proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein. Due to heterogeneous cleavage sites, a series of A beta peptides, including the major and widely studied species A beta 1-40 (A beta 40) and A beta 1-42 (A beta 42), are produced. In addition to the C-terminal heterogeneity of A beta peptides, significant amounts of N-terminal truncated (A beta 3-42) and pyroglutamate-modified amyloid-beta peptides (A beta pE3-42) have been identified in AD affected brains and shown to be more cytotoxic than unmodified A beta peptides. Little is known about the properties of their mixtures with A beta 42. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy is here employed to investigate the interaction of N-truncated peptides with A beta 42 at different molar ratios. We highlight the critical concentration of N-truncated forms influencing the aggregation kinetics of A beta 42. We provide evidence, at residue level, that the C-terminal region of A beta 42 is the locus of transient specific interactions with highly aggregation prone N-truncated alloforms.

She had an uneventful medical history; however, the physical examination upon hospital admission revealed a hypertensive emergency, papilledema, and 2+ dipstick proteinuria. Upon establishing the diagnosis of preeclampsia, aggressive therapy with corticosteroids, antihypertensive medication, and seizure prophylaxis was initiated. Hemodynamic stability was achieved within 24 hours and the patient remained in the observation unit located within the gynecology clinic. On the ninth day postadmission, however, her condition abruptly deteriorated and advanced to imminent eclampsia, accompanied by transient vision loss, altered mental status, and acute hypertensive crisis. After the patient underwent successful emergent delivery via caesarean section, a laboratory workup revealed hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count, suggesting HELLP syndrome, a serious complication of eclampsia. This patient concurrently developed posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, which was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and acute respiratory distress syndrome (the latter presented with diffuse bilateral infiltrates on x-ray and developing pulmonary edema in the absence of cardiac etiology). Because of these life-threatening dynamics, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for further treatment. This case is a rare cascade of life-threatening complications that developed in a patient and required skillful multidisciplinary decision making and experienced management within an acute critical care setting.

"Arrays of sharp conical spike microstructures are created by repeatedly irradiating silicon surfaces with focused femtosecond laser pulses in SF6. The absorbance of light is increased to approximately 90% in a wavelength range from the near ultraviolet (0.25 mu m) to the near infrared (2.5 mu m) by the microstructured silicon surface. The microstructured surface presents pitch-black because of enhanced absorption with a broad wavelength range, which is called black silicon. The unique microstructure morphology of black silicon surface formed by femtosecond laser can also bring a lot of other surface functions, for example, self-cleaning and field emission. These functions make black silicon highly desirable in solar energy, detectors and other fields. Therefore, the forming mechanism and conditions of fabrication optimization for black silicon microstructure have always been the focus of research. In our work, the sample is moved by motor-controlled stage while the laser beam is fixed. In the case of laser beam scanning, arrays of sharp conical spikes on the silicon are manufactured in 70 kPa SF6. The aim of the experiment is to find how to optimize the distribution of the laser energy in a number of laser accumulation pulses (the combination of single pulse energy and pulse number) to control the surface morphology of the black silicon. Experimental results show that there appears a bottleneck effect of morphology size growth with the increase of laser irradiation (improving the single pulse energy or increasing pulse accumulation number). Excessive energy accumulation brings no extra effect on optimizing and controlling of microstructure morphology on the surface. Based on theoretical results obtained from a physical model we proposed, we find that the reason for this phenomenon is that the microstructure morphology induced by former sequence pulse modulates the laser energy absorption of current laser pulse, and changes the laser ablation efficiency of the current pulse. According to this physical mechanism, we propose a new way of optimizing surface morphology, with fixing the total laser irradiation energy. And the size and distribution of surface morphology can be achieved by optimizing the distribution of the laser energy in a number of laser accumulation pulses. This approach can not only improve the efficiency of silicon surface preparation of microstructures but also reduce the surface defects and damage. Furthermore, the proposed method can reduce the energy consumption in the process of femtosecond machining. It is of great significance for the engineering application of black silicon.

"A hanging-type sand-retaining wall is a very common sand-blocking fence structure used to prevent sand movement. This type of wall is widely used along the Qinghai-Tibet and Gobi desert railways in Xinjiang, Western China. To analyze the characteristics of wind-sand flow fields under the effect of such a sand fence structure, a wind tunnel test and a field test were carried out. The wind tunnel test showed the zoning characteristics of the flow fields under the effect of the hanging-type sand-retaining wall, and the field test provided the sediment transport data for effective wind-proof interval and the sand resistance data in the front and behind the sand-retaining wall. The consistency of the wind-sand flow fields with the spatial distribution characteristic of wind-carried sand motion was verified by the correspondences of the acceleration zone in the flow field and the negative elevation points of the percentage variations of the sand collection rate. The spatial distribution characteristic of the field sand collection data further showed the spatial structural characteristic of the sandy air currents under the action of the hanging-type sand-retaining wall and the sand resistance characteristic of the sand-retaining wall. This systematic study on the wind-sand flow fields under the control of the hanging-type sand-retaining wall provides a theoretical basis for the rational layout of sand control engineering systems and the efficient utilization of a hanging-type sand-retaining wall.

"1. The attraction of natural enemies towards herbivore-induced plant volatiles is a well-documented phenomenon. However, the majority of published studies are carried under optimal water and nutrient regimes and with just one herbivore. But what happens when additional levels of ecological complexity are added? Does the presence of a second herbivore, microorganisms, and abiotic stress interfere with plant-natural enemy communication? or is communication stable enough to withstand disruption by additional biotic and abiotic factors? 2. Investigating the effects of these additional levels of ecological complexity is key to understanding the stability of tritrophic interactions in natural ecosystems and may aid to forecast the impact of environmental disturbances on these, especially in climate change scenarios, which are often associated with modifications in plant and arthropod species distribution and increased levels of abiotic stress. 3. This review explores the literature on natural enemy attraction to herbivore-induced volatiles when, besides herbivory, plants are challenged by additional biotic and abiotic factors. 4.

"As building information modeling (BIM) systems continue to be widely adopted, there is an increasing demand for an active construction schedule management system with more advanced decision-making capabilities. For example, if overlapping between construction activities is significant, the performance of construction operations for the corresponding activities may deteriorate. Thus, a viable construction schedule should be formulated in order to minimize overlapping of proximate construction activities. An active system can be regarded as a certain solution for this issue. The purpose of this study is to develop a systematic methodology and computer system for an optimal construction schedule simulation that minimize overlapping activities for the enhancement of a project's operational performance. This study centers on identifying overlapping activities, applying fuzzy theory, and analyzing risk levels for schedule overlap issues.

"Adolescents in the United States are known to be sleep deprived; early school start times, a biological propensity to stay up late, and a variety of wake-inducing activities lead to teens who often do not sleep enough. This chronic lack of sleep has measurable negative effects on health and well-being for adolescents. Though research has documented adolescent sleep behavior, few studies have addressed perceptions of sleep. The purpose of this study was to identify common sources of sleep information for a sample of Southwestern adolescents and examine general message content delivered to adolescents by each source. A convenience sample of 51 adolescents (mean age 14.5) completed a semi-structured, in-person interview between October 2006 and November 2007 in a Tucson, Arizona high school. Participant observation and a brief questionnaire regarding parent behavior were used to triangulate results. Parents, teachers, and in some cases the media stressed the importance of sleep for teens, while friends typically complained of tiredness. Individual experiences of sleep were reported to shape future sleep behavior. Rationales for adequate sleep included value placed on alertness, health, and achievement. Improving sleep in adolescents will not only require further education of the ""sleep messengers"" about the negative health consequences of inadequate sleep, but a larger cultural shift in how healthy sleep for teenagers is conceived and prioritized by schools, families and adolescents themselves.

"A common issue with many system identification problems is that the true input to the system is unknown. This paper extends a previously presented indirect modelling framework that deals with identification of systems where the input is partially or fully unknown. In this framework, unknown inputs are eliminated by using additional measurements that directly or indirectly contain information about the unknown inputs. The resulting indirect predictor model is only dependent on known and measured signals and can be used to estimate the desired dynamics or properties. Since the input of the indirect model contains both known inputs and measurements that could all be correlated with the same disturbances as the output, estimation of the indirect model has similar challenges as a closed-loop estimation problem. In fact, due to the generality of the indirect modelling framework, it unifies a number of already existing system identification problems that are contained as special cases. For completeness, the paper is concluded with one method that can be used to estimate the indirect model as well as an experimental verification to show the applicability of the framework.

"A high frequency dual-buck full-bridge inverter for small power renewable energy applications is proposed in this paper. The implementation of the wide band gap SiC (Silicon Carbide) power device contributes to the high switching frequency of 400 kHz. This high frequency contributes to reduced converter volume as well as improved power density, which greatly strengthens its portability and application range. For the control strategy, a voltage-current dual loop controller is employed. A three-pole-three-zero (3P3Z) compensator is applied in the current loop in order to track the current reference without static error. A voltage loop two-pole two-zero (2P2Z) compensator is used to generate the current reference for stabilizing the DC bus voltage. Not only is the inner current loop analyzed in detail, which includes the modeling of the equivalent inductor-capacitor-inductor (LCL)-type inverter and the design of the 3P3Z compensator, but also the outer voltage loop is discussed, the model of which is established based on the energy balance. Furthermore, a feedback linearization method is adopted to simplify the duty cycle calculation and helps to accelerate the control speed. A second-order generalized integrator software phase lock loop (SOGI-SPLL) is employed to obtain the phase angle and to synchronize the inverter output current with the grid voltage. A parallel structure algorithm is conducted based on a dual-core microcontroller unit (MCU) for the first time to control the high frequency inverter. This approach avoids the contradiction between the high frequency operation and the limited computing capacity of the conventional single-core MCUs. The software structure, time-consuming distribution, and interactive communication method are analyzed in detailed. Finally, this paper verifies the feasibility of the theoretical analyses through simulation and experiments based on a 1 kW prototype.

"Accurate prediction of software defects is of crucial importance in software engineering. Software defect prediction comprises two major procedures: (i) Design of appropriate software metrics to represent characteristic software system properties; and (ii) development of effective regression models for count data, allowing for accurate prediction of the number of software defects. Although significant research effort has been devoted to software metrics design, research in count data regression has been rather limited. More specifically, most used methods have not been explicitly designed to tackle the problem of metrics driven software defect counts prediction, thus postulating irrelevant assumptions, such as (log-)linearity of the modeled data. In addition, a lack of simple and efficient algorithms for posterior computation has made more elaborate hierarchical Bayesian approaches appear unattractive in the context of software defect prediction. To address these issues, in this paper we introduce a doubly stochastic Poisson process for count data regression, the failure log-rate of which is driven by a novel latent space stochastic feed forward neural network. Our approach yields simple and efficient updates for its complicated conditional distributions by means of sampling importance resampling and error backpropagation. We exhibit the efficacy of our approach using publicly available and benchmark datasets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

There is strong evidence of the benefit of identifying and treating osteoporosis after MTF, and there has been discussion of the possible role that orthopedic surgeons might play in the management of osteoporosis after MTF. The study surveyed orthopedic surgeons in rural and regional Southeast Australia to determine their attitudes to investigation and management of osteoporosis, the role health professionals should play, and the communication and coordination of follow-up care. Methods A survey was developed and piloted prior to being posted to 69 orthopedic surgeons asking for their opinions about the general management of osteoporosis, and the roles and responsibilities of health professionals in dealing with osteoporosis following an MTF. Results Responses were received from 42 participants (60.8%) with the majority of respondents agreeing that it is important to treat osteoporosis following MTF. Less than 15% of respondents felt that it was their responsibility to initiate discussion or treatment or investigation after MTF. No respondent felt that the coordination of osteoporosis care was good and 45% stated it was poor. Communication after discharge is mostly left to the hospital (30%), while 20% stated they did not follow up at all.

"A new design for metamaterial absorber with triple band in X band range is proposed for Radar cross section reduction in stealth technology. The proposed metamaterial absorber has the advantage of ease design. It is a three layered structure, designed with modified ring resonators printed on a dielectric material with a metal ground. By proper tuning of the geometry parameters of the structure, a triple band metamaterial absorber is achieved and it is adjusted to match the effective impedance of metamaterial absorber to the free space. Hence, there is no wave transmission, minimized reflection and the absorption rate is maximized in all the bands. The resonant frequency bands are at 7.7 GHz, 9.2 GHz and 11.1 GHz with absorption rates of 99.7%, 98% and 94% respectively. The bandwidths measured at the triple band are 0.2757 GHz, 0.311 GHz and 0.2182 GHz. The total miniaturized metamaterial absorber unit cell size is 6 mm x 12 mm x 0.705 mm. Simulation results show that the proposed absorber with triple band and with high absorption rate is well suited for Radar cross section reduction in stealth technology.

"A majority of RFID authentication scenarios involve a single tag that is identified independent of other tags in the field of the reader. However, there are situations that necessitate simultaneous authentication of multiple tags as well as the verification of their simultaneous physical proximity to the reader. Duels (2004) introduced yoking proof for simultaneous authentication of multiple RFID tags. Several researchers have since then developed variants of yoking proof using both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. Given that the ambient conditions are bound to be very similar for all objects that are in close physical proximity to one another, we critically evaluate the use of various relevant ambient conditions for this purpose. Based on our evaluation, we choose to use tag temperature and develop a variant of yoking proof protocol for simultaneous authentication of multiple tags.(C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"A preconditioned Navier-Stokes (NS) method is developed for multiphase flow with application to the water entry problem of moving bodies. The method employs a dual time-preconditioned technique with multiblock and parallel computing to improve the computational productivity. Novel, generalized pseudo time terms are added into the multiphase NS equations, taking advantage of two previous suggestions reported in the literature. The NS solver is formulated in the moving curvilinear coordinate system for multiphase flow, including water, vapor, and air fluids. In order to handle the motion of an object in three-dimensional (3D) water entry problems, a six degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) rigid body motion model and a moving Chimera grid scheme are dynamically integrated"" into the NS solver. The Chimera domain decomposition scheme uses an overlapping, embedded, and moving grid approach to facilitate the flow simulation of arbitrary translationally and rotationally complex geometries among various computational blocks. The domain communication module is fully parallel and is ideally suited for handling moving body problems. To demonstrate the capacities of the method, several sets of example computations are performed and presented in this paper. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"A broadband graphene absorber with simple structure is proposed in this paper. The substrate used in this paper is 1.3 mm in thickness and constructed with 0.6 mm depth grooves periodically, which can be treated as substrates with a thickness of 1.3 mm and 0.7 mm arranging periodically. The combination of quartz substrate with different heights can realize the superposition of two adjacent frequency bands which leads to broad band characteristic of the absorber. The absorption rate of the absorber is obtained by software High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) 14.0. The relative bandwidth for the absorption rate above 90% is 27.1%, from 134 GHz to 176 GHz.

"AIM To investigate serum omentin and vaspin levels in cirrhotic patients; and to assess the relationship of these levels with hemostatic parameters, metabolic abnormalities, cirrhosis severity and etiology. METHODS Fifty-one cirrhotic patients (17 with portal vein thrombosis) were analyzed. Serum omentin and vaspin levels were measured with commercially available direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). To assess platelet activity, the following tests were performed using a MULTIPLATE (R) PLATELET FUNCTION ANALYZER: (1) an ADP-induced platelet activation test; (2) a cyclooxygenase dependent aggregation test (ASPI test); (3) a von Willebrand factor and glycoprotein Ib-dependent aggregation (using ristocetin) test (RISTO test); and (4) a test for thrombin receptor-activating peptide-6 induced activation of the thrombin receptor, which is sensitive to IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists. RESULTS Omentin, but not vaspin, serum concentrations were significantly decreased in patients with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) (P = 0.01). Prothrombin levels were significantly increased in patients with PVT (P = 0.01). The thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) test results were significantly lower in the PVT group (P = 0.03). No significant differences in adipokines serum levels were found regarding the etiology or severity of liver cirrhosis assessed according to the Child-Pugh or Model of End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores. There was a significant increase in the TRAP (P = 0.03), ASPI (P = 0.001) and RISTO high-test (P = 0.02) results in patients with lower MELD scores. Serum omentin and vaspin levels were significantly down-regulated in patients without insulin resistance (P = 0.03, P = 0.02, respectively). A positive relationship between omentin and vaspin levels were found both when all of the patients were analyzed (r = 0.41, P = 0.01) and among those with PVT (r = 0.94, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Serum omentin levels are increased in patients without PVT. Cirrhosis origin and grade do not affect omentin and vaspin levels. The analyzed adipokines do not influence platelet activity.

"A load estimation algorithm based on k-means cluster analysis was developed. The algorithm applies cluster centres - of previously clustered load profiles - and distance functions to estimate missing and future measurements. Canberra, Manhattan, Euclidean, and Pearson correlation distances were investigated. Several case studies were implemented using daily and segmented load profiles of aggregated smart meters. Segmented profiles cover a time window that is less than or equal to 24 h. Simulation results show that Canberra distance outperforms the other distance functions. Results also show that the segmented cluster centres produce more accurate load estimates than daily cluster centres. Higher accuracy estimates were obtained with cluster centres in the range of 16-24 h. The developed load 'estimation algorithm can be integrated with state estimation or other network operational tools to enable better monitoring and control of distribution networks.

"A good skin detector that is capable of capturing skin tones under different conditions is important for human-machine interaction applications. In a general situation, skin detectors, such as skin probability maps or Gaussian mixture models, achieve acceptable skin segmentation results. However, the false positive rate increases significantly when the skin tones are in shadow or when skin-like background objects are under similar illumination. In this paper, we propose a novel skin feature learning algorithm based on stacked autoencoders, which are deep neural networks. To overcome the problems encountered in skin segmentation that are caused by different ethnicities and varying illumination conditions, the stacked autoencoders are utilized to learn more discriminative representations of the skin area in both the RGB color space and the HSV color space. Unlike traditional machine learning methods, instead of predicting each pixel individually, our algorithm utilizes blocks to learn the representations and detect the skin areas. The algorithm exploits the learning ability of deep neural networks to learn high-level representations of skin tones. Experiments on test images show that the proposed algorithm achieves acceptable results on several publicly available data sets. To reduce the difficulty of detecting skin pixels in these data sets, the ground truths of these data sets are commonly focused on foreground skin area detection. Our skin detector is also able to detect background areas, as shown in our experiments.

"Artisanal gold mining (galamsey) and cocoa farming are essential sources of income for local populations in Ghana. Unfortunately the former poses serious threats to the environment and human health, and conflicts with cocoa farming and other livelihoods. Timely and spatially referenced information on the extent of galamsey is needed to understand and limit the negative impacts of Mining. To address this, we use multi-date UK-DMC2 satellite images to map the extent and expansion of galamsey from 2011 to 2015. We map the total area of galamsey in 2013 over the cocoa growing area, Using k-means clustering on a cloud-free 2013 image with strong spectral contrast between galamsey and the surrounding vegetation. We also process a pair of hazy images from 2011 and 2015 with Multivariate Alteration Detection to map the 2011-2015 galamsey expansion in a subset, labelled the change area. We use a set of visually interpreted random sample points to compute bias-corrected area estimates. We also delineate an indicative impact zone of pollution proportional to the density of galamsey, assuming a maximum radius of 10 km. In the cocoa growing area of Ghana, the estimated total area of galamsey in 2013 is 27,839 ha with an impact zone of 551,496 ha. In the change area, galamsey has more than tripled between 2011 and 2015, resulting in 603 ha of direct encroachment into protected forest reserves. Assuming the same growth rate for the rest of the cocoa growing area, the total area of galamsey in 2015 is estimated at 43,879 ha.

"A real-time, rapid emergency control (EC) model is proposed to cope with sudden water pollution accidents in long-distance water transfer projects. The EC model outputs the method of EC based on pollutant properties. A generalized form of EC model is proposed and tested with a demonstrative project. The rapid prediction formulas of emergency control parameters (ECPs) are proposed under different states of water diversion. The closing times of check gates and the pollution range are calculated by the rapid prediction formulas of ECPs. A case study is examined under the scenario of a sucrose spill in a demonstrative project conducted in the Fangshui to Puyang channel of the Beijing-Shijiazhuang Emergency Water Supply Project in the middle route of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project. The relative errors of peak concentration and arrival time of peak concentration are less than 20%. However, we could not use an actual toxic soluble pollutant to validate the EC model, so we performed the experiment with sucrose to test the EC model based on its concentration variation. The final result shows that the model is able to play a fundamental role in the decisions involved in the Emergency Environmental Decision Support System.

"A 1 kW-class electrochemical reactor for hydrogen production was developed using bipolar plates. To fabricate thick, large-area electrodes, a particle electrode fabrication method was also introduced. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and galvanostatic performance measurements were performed to evaluate the particle electrodes. The results show that the particle electrodes exhibit an excellent charge performance despite the electrode material layer being relatively thick and highly porous. The electrochemical reactor contained 20 single cells stacked together with 30 A h of nickel hydroxide and 15 A h of metal hydride as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The electrochemical tests showed that the stack exhibited a high hydrogen production efficiency with a maximum current efficiency of 95.3% for hydrogen production and a hydrogen evolution amount per unit input electrical energy of 259.1 mL/W h at 0.2 C. At high current densities (2.0 C), a rapid temperature increase was also observed during the charging process, which led to a reduction of the hydrogen production efficiency. Therefore, further design modifications are needed to control heat generation during operation of the device. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"An image processing technique using the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of infrared thermal data was developed to improve the speed of assessment of 2D heat source fields accompanying mechanical transformation. This method involved the generation of a reduced orthonormal basis to approximate thermal fields prior to heat source estimation. The robustness of the method was first assessed using a penalising benchmark test. This test involved artificially setting several tricky situations that arise in practice (high diffusivity, low signal-to-noise ratio, complex heat source distribution, etc.). Application of the method to several experimental temperature fields obtained by an infrared focal plane array camera is then presented. The error between the POD approximated solution in terms of heat sources and a reference solution, computed via a local least squares fitting method, was found to be negligible, thus confirming the efficiency and advantages of the POD preprocessing technique - the method enabled us to obtain a reliable estimate of heat sources while drastically reducing the computation cost in terms of CPU time.

"Aberrant angiogenesis and vascular remodeling are the main features of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Kallistatin is an anti-angiogenic peptide with known effects on endothelial cells. This study aimed to demonstrate that kallistatin has beneficial effects on bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis in a rat model by inhibiting angiogenesis. Twenty-five rats were randomly divided into five experimental groups: (A) Saline only (SA)-as the negative control, (B) BLM only (BLM)-as the model group, (C) BLM and 0.1 mg/kg kallistatin (L-Kal), (D) BLM and 0.5 mg/kg kallistatin (M-Kal), and (E) BLM and 2.5 mg/kg kallistatin (H-Kal). Fibrillar collagen was quantified by Masson's trichrome and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), a-smooth-muscle-actin (alpha-SMA) and microvascular density (MVD) were measured by immunohistochemistry. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were assayed by Western immunoblotting or ELISA. Daily administration of kallistatin attenuated fibrosis in BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, as shown by histology. During inflammation from BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, kallistatin reduced the number of inflammatory cells infiltrating the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Kallistatin also inhibited VEGF expression and phosphorylation of VEGFR2 (Flk-1). In vitro, kallistatin blocked tube formation by inhibiting Flk-1 and GSK-3 beta phosphorylation. The results demonstrated that continuous administration of kallistatin attenuated BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis and improved survival of BLM rats. Reducing pulmonary fibrosis was achieved by partial inhibition of pulmonary inflammation and angiogenesis.

"Aerial gamma ray surveys are an important tool for national security, scientific, arid industrial interests in determining locations of both anthropogenic and natural sources of radioactivity. There is a relationship between radioactivity and geology and in the past this relationship has been used to predict geology from an aerial survey. The purpose of this project is to develop a method to predict the radiologic exposure rate of the geologic materials by creating a high resolution background model. The intention is for this method to be used in an emergency response scenario where the background radiation environment is unknown. Two study areas in Southern Nevada have been modeled using geologic data, images from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), geochemical data, and pre-existing low resolution aerial surveys from the National Uranium Resource Evaluation (NURE) Survey. Using these data, geospatial areas that are homogenous in terms of K, U, and Th, referred to as background radiation units, are defined and the gamma ray exposure rate is predicted. The prediction is compared to data collected via detailed aerial survey by the Department of Energy's Remote Sensing Lab - Nellis, allowing for the refinement of the technique. By using geologic units to define radiation background units of exposed bedrock and ASTER visualizations to subdivide and define radiation background units within alluvium, successful models have been produced for Government Wash, north of Lake Mead, and for the western shore of Lake Mohave, east of Searchlight, NV.

The results of the study demonstrate that alternative solutions such as expanded clay lightweight aggregates can be used in interaction with geosynthetics in comparison to classical soil. The new type of geosynthetic tubes filled dynamically with expanded clay lightweight aggregate was tested in situ under compressive loading. The geosynthetic tube was instrumented with load cell transducers and the characteristic cross-section was obtained from three-dimensional scanner measurements after loading. Next, a simplified engineering formulation for geosynthetic tubes under compressive loading and unloading was evaluated including the influence of volume variation of the tube. It is based on the classical approach from soil mechanics and it produces the required design tensile force of the tube dependent on geosynthetic stiffness. The experimental results of compressive loading tests were compared with analytical equations. The results are discussed and show the influence of the geosynthetic stiffness on the behaviour of the tube in terms of loading capacity, volume variation and cross-section of the tube. The agreement between theoretical analyses and experimental results was reasonably good and can be formally accepted for a given volume variation of the geosynthetic tube.

"Age is a critical factor in the prevalence of tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease. To observe how an aging phenotype interacts with and affects the pathological intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau, the tauopathy mouse model pR5 (expressing P301L mutant human tau) was back-crossed more than ten times onto a senescence-accelerated SAMP8 background to establish the new strain, SApT. Unlike SAMP8 mice, pR5 mice are characterized by a robust tau pathology particularly in the amygdala and hippocampus. Analysis of age-matched SApT mice revealed that pathological tau phosphorylation was increased in these brain regions compared to those in the parental pR5 strain. Moreover, as revealed by immunohistochemistry, phosphorylation of critical tau phospho-epitopes (P-Ser202/P-Ser205 and P-Ser235) was significantly increased in the amygdala of SApT mice in an age-dependent manner, suggesting an age-associated effect of tau phosphorylation. Anxiety tests revealed that the older cohort of SApT mice (10months vs. 8months) exhibited a behavioural pattern similar to that observed for age-matched tau transgenic pR5 mice and not the SAMP8 parental mice. Learning and memory, however, appeared to be governed by the accelerated aging background of the SAMP8 strain, as at both ages investigated, SAMP8 and SApT mice showed a decreased learning capacity compared to pR5 mice. We therefore conclude that accelerated aging exacerbates pathological tau phosphorylation, leading to changes in normal behaviour. These findings further suggest that SApT mice may be a useful novel model in which to study the role of a complex geriatric phenotype in tauopathy.

In fact, by hybridization of energy sources, advantages of different sources are achievable. In this converter, the loads power can be flexibly distributed between input sources. Also, charging or discharging of energy storages by other input sources can be controlled properly. The proposed converter has several outputs with different voltage levels which makes it suitable for interfacing to multilevel inverters. Using of a multilevel inverter leads to reduction of voltage harmonics which, consequently, reduces torque ripple of electric motor in electric vehicles. Also, electric vehicles which using dc motor have at least two different dc voltage levels, one for ventilation system and cabin lightening and other for supplying electric motor.

"A seamless and secure handover is always one of the important design goals of the cellular networks. The handover scheme of 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless networks is complex due to the presence of two possible different types of base stations. In LTE communication systems, a normal base station is referred to as an eNodeB (eNB). What increases the level of complexity of the system is the fact that the other kind of base stations, namely, Home eNodeB (HeNB), cannot directly communicate with eNB. In the LTE networks, the handover scenarios involving a HeNB could result in a complicated handover procedure. Besides, since key chains have been used in the handover processes, it is found to be lack of backward security. Therefore, in order to handle the handover involving a HeNB efficiently with security provisioning, in this paper, a proxy signature based handover scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme works based on the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithm, which makes the computational cost of the handover process smaller compared to other handover schemes.

Oversampling-dithering features of third-order Delta Sigma modulators are used to increase the DPWM resolution during the converter nominal operation and, moreover, as the core key to compute the SI algorithm. A modified structure of a noise shaper is used to handle the resolution of the SI algorithm over a range of the desired frequencies during the nonparametric identification.

The SI method has been validated with different buck converter configurations, and has successfully been integrated and measured into a digitally controlled buck converters prototype for automotive safety application.

"A model that accurately predicts, at the time of admission, the Length of Stay (LOS) for hospitalized patients could be an effective tool for healthcare providers. It could enable early interventions to prevent complications, enabling more efficient utilization of manpower and facilities in hospitals. In this study, we apply a regression tree (Cubist) model for predicting the LOS, based on static inputs, that is, values that are known at the time of admission and that do not change during patient's hospital stay. The model was trained and validated on de-identified administrative data from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospitals in Pittsburgh, PA. We chose to use a Cubist model because it produced more accurate predictions than did alternative techniques. In addition, tree models enable us to examine the classification rules learned from the data, in order to better understand the factors that are most correlated with hospital LOS. Cubist recursively partitions the data set as it estimates linear regressions for each partition, and the error level differs for different partitions, so that it is possible to deduce what are the characteristics of patients whose LOS can be accurately predicted at admission, and what are the characteristics of patients for whom the LOS estimate at that point in time is more highly uncertain. For example, our model indicates that the prediction error is greater for patients who had more admissions in the recent past, and for those who had longer previous hospital stays. Our approach suggests that mapping the cases into a higher dimensional space, using a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, helps to separate them by their level of Cubist error, using a Support Vector Machine (SVM).

We report the use of this device and our clinical results at 24 months of follow-up in a prospective series of 34 patients who underwent single or multilevel corpectomy for the treatment of cervical spondylosis. Thirty-four consecutive patients underwent single or multilevel cervical corpectomy followed by the insertion of a WETC for the treatment of cervical spondylosis at Department of Neurology and Psychiatry ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Italy, from May 2011 to May 2013. Patients affected by cervical spondylosis with cervical lordosis >0 degrees were included. Patients affected by cervical lordosis < 0 degrees, osteoporosis, or other cervical diseases were excluded. The mean postsurgical Nurick's grade was significantly lower than the mean presurgical Nurick's grade (mean = 0.98 for postsurgical Nurick's grade and mean = 2.42 for presurgical Nurick's grade). Four patients (11.7 %) presented subsidence respectively of 1, 2, 2, and 3 mm at 24 months of radiological follow-up. Postoperative complications occurred in five patients (14.7 %). Our case series at 24 months of follow-up demonstrates that the use of a WETC obtains good clinical results after single or multiple corpectomy in patients not affected by osteoporosis who do not require cervical lordosis correction. During the insertion of the device, an adequate preparation of the end plates is suggested and their over distraction should be avoided.

"A method for the shape finding of a specific type of self-anchored suspension bridge whose main cable is three-dimensionally curved is proposed in this study. The method, referred to as the coordinate iteration method (CIM), is developed from the force equilibrium features of the rational arch axis for suspension cables modeled by truss-cable elements. By establishing the linear iterative equations in terms of unknown coordinates and updating the relation matrices iteratively, a trial profile of the three-dimensional cable-only system easily and stably converges to the target system. The CIM is then extended to the shape finding of the total bridge system with the aid of a specific numerical model proposed in this study referred to as the indiscrimination coordinate rod model (ICRM). This model is used to simulate the core deformation effects of the total bridge. The detailed procedure undertaken to establish a finite-element model of the equilibrium system for the finished dead load state based on CIM and ICRM is also presented. The precision and efficiency of the method are demonstrated through actual numerical examples. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

"Ambient assisted living can facilitate optimum health and wellness by aiding physical, mental and social well-being. In this paper, patients' psychiatric symptoms are collected through lightweight biosensors and web-based psychiatric screening scales in a smart home environment and then analyzed through machine learning algorithms to provide ambient intelligence in a psychiatric emergency. The psychiatric states are modeled through a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and the model parameters are estimated using a Viterbi path counting and scalable Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI)-based training algorithm. The most likely psychiatric state sequence of the corresponding observation sequence is determined, and an emergency psychiatric state is predicted through the proposed algorithm. Moreover, to enable personalized psychiatric emergency care, a service a web of objects-based framework is proposed for a smart-home environment. In this framework, the biosensor observations and the psychiatric rating scales are objectified and virtualized in the web space. Then, the web of objects of sensor observations and psychiatric rating scores are used to assess the dweller's mental health status and to predict an emergency psychiatric state. The proposed psychiatric state prediction algorithm reported 83.03 percent prediction accuracy in an empirical performance study.

"Adipose tissue possesses crucial immunological features in the development of comorbidities of obesity. Complex interactions between the metabolic system and cells of the immune system are the cause but are not fully understood. Autoimmune diseases might therefore be influenced by obesity. Epidemiological studies provide evidence of only a modest association between obesity and the development of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. In obesity the course of inflammatory rheumatic diseases is aggravated, as subjectively measured by activity parameters; however, laboratory parameters show no differences and radiographic examinations reveal less bone destruction in obesity. Furthermore, there are indications for a poorer response to treatment especially with infliximab in patients with an increased body mass index (BMI). Weight loss has a positive effect on the course of joint diseases. Due to deficits in the currently available studies there is insufficient evidence to recommend individualization of treatment decisions based on the BMI.

"Aging causes micro-and macrovascular endothelial dysfunction, as assessed by endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD), which can be prevented and reversed by habitual aerobic exercise (AE) in men. However, in estrogen-deficient postmenopausal women, whole forearm microvascular EDD has not been studied, and a beneficial effect of AE on macrovascular EDD has not been consistently shown. We assessed forearm blood flow in response to brachial artery infusions of acetylcholine (FBFACh), a measure of whole forearm microvascular EDD, and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a measure of macrovascular EDD, in 12 premenopausal sedentary women (Pre-S; 24 +/- 1 yr; (V) over dot(O2max)= 37.5 +/- 1.6 ml.kg (-1).min(-1)), 25 estrogen-deficient postmenopausal sedentary women (Post-S; 62 +/- 1 yr; (V) over dot(O2max) +/- 24.7 +/- 0.9 ml.kg(-1).min(-1)), and 16 estrogen-deficient postmenopausal AE-trained women (Post-AE; 59 +/- 1 yr; (V) over dot(O2max) +/- 40.4 +/- 1.4 ml.kg(-1)min(-1)). FBFACh was lower in Post-S and Post-AE compared with Pre-S women (135 +/- 9 and 116 +/- 17 vs. 193 +/- 21 AUC, respectively, both P < 0.008), whereas Post-S and Post-AE women were not different (P = 0.3). Brachial artery FMD was 34% (5.73 +/- 0.67%) and 45% (4.79 +/- 0.57%) lower in Post-S and Post-AE, respectively, vs. Pre-S women (8.69 +/- 0.95%, both P <= 0.01), but not different between Post-S and Post-AE women (P = 0.3). Post-AE women had lower circulating C-reactive protein and oxidized low-density lipoprotein compared with Post-S women (0.5 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.2 mg/l and 40 +/- 4 vs. 55 +/- 3 U/l, respectively, both P = 0.01), but these markers were not correlated to FBFACh (P = 0.3) or brachial artery FMD (P = 0.8). These findings are consistent with the idea that habitual AE does not protect against age/menopause-related whole forearm micro-and macrovascular endothelial dysfunction in healthy nonobese estrogen-deficient postmenopausal women, despite being associated with lower systemic markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first study to demonstrate that habitual aerobic exercise may not protect against age/menopauserelated whole forearm microvascular endothelial dysfunction in healthy nonobese estrogen-deficient postmenopausal women, consistent with recent findings regarding macrovascular endothelial function. This is in contrast to what is observed in healthy middle-aged and older aerobic exercise-trained men.

"A fully-integrated tuner for digital satellite audio radio applications using a second-zero-IF dual conversion architecture was realized in a 0.2 mu m SiGe BiCMOS technology. An autonomous RF-AGC and a channel decoder IC controlled IF-AGC were used to optimize the signal path gain for a wide range of input signal levels. A single PLL drives both RF and IF mixers, resulting in a smaller die area and lower power dissipation. Down-converting the signal to baseband further reduces tuner's power due to a lower required ADC sampling frequency and resolution. Providing a digital baseband I/Q output allows the implementation of the channel decode IC in a standard digital CMOS process, reducing the overall receiver cost. SDARS tuner performance includes: 5dB noise figure, 55dB image rejection, -100dBm input sensitivity, +15dBm IIP3 at min gain, 40/60dB RF/IF AGC range, 120mA current consumption from a 3.3V supply and 15mm(2) die area.

"Among the preeclampsia-related long non-cording RNAs (lncRNAs) screened with a gene chip in our preliminary study, uc.187 attracted our attention because of its high conservation across different species and significant positive correlation with preeclampsia (PE). The literature and bioinformatics analysis suggested that lncRNA uc. 187 might be associated with cell growth, invasion, and apoptosis. The expression of uc. 187 in severe preeclamptic placentas (n = 31) and normal placentas (n = 18) was evaluated by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We constructed a silencing lentivirus vector (uc. 187 siRNA) to explore the biological function of uc. 187 in the development and progression of HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells in vitro. Furthermore, we utilized CCK8 analysis, a transwell invasion assay, and flow cytometry to determine the role of uc. 187 in the proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis of HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells. The proteins related to proliferation (PCNA, Ki67), invasion (MMP-2/-9 and TIMP-1), and apoptosis (caspase-3, Bcl-2) were evaluated with a Western blot assay. The results showed that there was an obvious upregulation of uc. 187 expression in preeclamptic placental tissues. In addition, uc. 187 silencing enhanced cell proliferation and invasion and reduced the cellular apoptotic response. Taken together, our findings suggest for the first time that abnormal expression of lncRNA uc. 187 may lead to the aberrant biological behavior of HTR-8/SVneo cells. Therefore, we propose uc. 187 as a novel lncRNA molecule that might contribute to the development of PE and might represent a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for this disease.

"A complete 3D visualization method for virtual liver lesion model was proposed by taking patients' abdomen CT slices as data source. Firstly, Gradient Vector Flow-Snake algorithm that combines with region force was adopted to fast and accurately extract the contour points in patients' CT slices. Then 3D cloud data of these contour points was simplified uniformly, and a distance-field-based method of distribution field fitting for B-spline surface was presented to fast establish the lesion model roughly. Then, an interactive node fine tuning method Interactive Marching Nodes was proposed, so the model can be optimized according to requirements of users. Finally, realistic lesion model was generated through texture mapping. Experiments suggest that this approach is suitable for various kinds of lesions with the whole process taking only a few minutes, and the generated model has high precision, which is of some significance in the study of virtual surgeries.

"Accumulating evidence suggests that post-diagnostic insulin levels may influence colorectal cancer (CRC) survival. Yet, no previous study has examined CRC survival in relation to a post-diagnostic diet rich in foods that increase post-prandial insulin levels. We hypothesized that glycemic and insulin scores (index or load; derived from food frequency questionnaire data) may be associated with survival from specific CRC subtypes sensitive to the insulin signaling pathway. We prospectively followed 1,160 CRC patients from the Nurses' Health Study (1980-2012) and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2012), resulting in 266 CRC deaths in 10,235 person-years. CRC subtypes were defined by seven tumor biomarkers (KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA mutations, and IRS1, IRS2, FASN and CTNNB1 expression) implicated in the insulin signaling pathway. For overall CRC and each subtype, hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for an increase of one standard deviation in each of glycemic and insulin scores were estimated using time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model. We found that insulin scores, but not glycemic scores, were positively associated with CRC mortality (HR=1.19, 95% CI=1.02-1.38 for index; HR=1.23, 95% CI=1.04-1.47 for load). The significant positive associations appeared more pronounced among PIK3CA wild-type cases and FASN-negative cases, with HR ranging from 1.36 to 1.60 across insulin scores. However, we did not observe statistically significant interactions of insulin scores with PIK3CA, FASN, or any other tumor marker (p interaction>0.12). While additional studies are needed for definitive evidence, a high-insulinogenic diet after CRC diagnosis may contribute to worse CRC survival. What's new? Elevated circulating insulin levels are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis and may also be linked to CRC survival. According to this report, insulin's contribution to CRC prognosis are potentially reflected in differences in the insulinogenic diet-mortality association by tumor biomarkers related to the insulin signaling pathway. In a prospective cohort study of CRC patients, a high-insulinogenic diet was linked to poor CRC survival primarily when CRCs were of PIK3CA wild-type or FASN-negative, though the interactions were not statistically significant. Insulin scores were also significantly associated with all-cause mortality among FASN-negative cases. No associations were detected between glycemic scores and CRC mortality.

"A sensitive pH-triggered electrical switch is demonstrated by using a layer-structured silver nanowire/polyaniline nanocomposite film fabricated via an easy vertical spinning method. The as-prepared nanocomposite film shows the high electrical conductivity of 1.03 x 10(4) S cm(-1) at the Ag-NW areal density of 0.84 mg cm(-2) and a good cycling stability. Particularly, because of the layered structure, the switch achieves a very high contrast ratio of ca.9 x 108, which is 2-6 orders higher than that reported previously. The high electrical conductivity and the high switching ratio make the layer-structured nanocomposite film a sensitive switch candidate for pH-responsive systems. Finally, a smart pH self-adjusting switching system is successfully designed using the as-prepared layer-structured nanocomposite film.

"A roadmap for a semi-algebraic set S is a curve which has a non-empty and connected intersection with all connected components of S. Hence, this kind of object, introduced by Canny, can be used to answer connectivity queries (with applications, for instance, to motion planning) but has also become of central importance in effective real algebraic geometry, since it is used in higher-level algorithms. In this article, we provide a probabilistic algorithm which computes roadmaps for smooth and bounded real algebraic sets. Its output size and running time are polynomial in (nD)(nlog(d)), where D is the maximum of the degrees of the input polynomials, d is the dimension of the set under consideration and n is the number of variables. More precisely, the running time of the algorithm is essentially subquadratic in the output size. Even under our assumptions, it is the first roadmap algorithm with output size and running time polynomial in (nD)(nlog(d)).

"A flexible synthesis procedure for nth-order current-mode low-pass filter using current controlled current differencing buffered amplifier (CC-CDBA) is given. The proposed method is based on drawing the signal-flow graph from the given transfer function and obtaining the circuit realization from the graph. The proposed configuration uses n+1 CC-CIDBAs and n capacitors. It is straightforward to find the values of the passive elements from the coefficients of the transfer function to be realized and the undamped natural frequency and quality factor can be adjusted electronically without changing the values of the passive components. The proposed structure uses the cascade connection of second and/or first order filter sections. Therefore it carries the general advantages of this type of structures. Further, any current ratio transfer function can be shown to be realized by adding a weighted summer without affecting the basic configuration. The simulation results for a fourth order band-pass elliptic filter are included for the verification of the theory.

"A significant proportion of the solar irradiance that reaches the Earth's surface is normally attenuated by atmospheric properties and overcast conditions related to the rainy season. The Solar Analyst (SA) model, irradiance and long term precipitation data were used to assess this relationship in Guadalajara, Mexico. A spatial analysis based on morphological and statistical criteria increased the model's certainty. The SA model explains 95.4% of the irradiation variability observed on the ground, with average uncertainties of 3.7% during clear sky conditions in the dry season and 4.4% on sunny days in the wet season. The meteorological data analysis shows that total precipitation in 2014 had an atypical temporal distribution and was slightly lower (12.6%) than the average from 1991 to 2012. A deficit of 39% in precipitation compared to the long term average was found in the first half of the season, which was later partially compensated. This deficit was interpreted as a temporary delay in high values of precipitation. Based on the potential average irradiation from the SA model and field observations, it can be concluded that overcast conditions related to rainfall through 2014 attenuated approximately 28.5% of the incoming solar energy. Taking the global energy balance into account, this fraction was higher in comparison to the energy proportion reflected by the cloud's albedo (ca 23%). These results suggest that both the high proportion of energy attenuated and atypical weather conditions may be local effects of large-scale phenomena such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.

"A methodology for the design of a thermal distortion compensation system is presented which will assist the manufacturing processes to reach higher levels of accuracy when working with large machines in common shop floor environments. A parametric state-space representation was selected as model architecture, providing multiple inputs and outputs capability and a compact formulation that takes into account previous thermal states of the machine. Inputs for the model are spindle speed and temperatures of main motor gearbox and room air. Outputs are the estimations of the thermal drift of the machine tool centre point along the three axes in different positions within the working volume. Model parameters were numerically identified with initial experimental tests performed in a large gantry-type milling machine, measuring mentioned variables and also thermal distortion values using a reference artifact along with non-contact proximity sensors. Proposed model was finally verified with a new validation measurement in the machine. Obtained results revealed 80% of error reduction in the vertical axis which comprised 70% of total thermal effects and 50% in the longitudinal X axis which comprised 25% of total thermal effects. Also it was concluded that the model benefits from using valuable information about the machine state from previous spindle speed register instead of using only temperature values. Proposed methodology benefits from providing a feasible implementation in real shop floor conditions without the necessity of including additional temperature sensors or probing systems in the machine.

"A promising development in the design of datacenters is the hybrid network architecture consisting of both optical and electrical elements. In this context, the joint problem of bandwidth allocation and VM-placement, a problem that only recently received attention in all-electrical datacenter networks, poses new and different challenges not addressed yet in hybrid datacenters. In particular, we foresee two issues: (i) the number of edge-switches that can be simultaneously reached using optical paths from an edge-switch is limited by the switch size, (ii) the dynamic creation of optical paths can potentially establish a constrained optical network topology leading to poor performance. We abstract the requests of tenants as virtual networks, and study the problem of embedding virtual networks on a hybrid datacenter, which translates to the joint problem of bandwidth allocation and placement such that the topology constraints of virtual networks are satisfied. We develop and analyse two algorithms for embedding dynamically arriving virtual network demands on a hybrid optical-electrical datacenter. Through simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of not only exploiting the already established optical paths, but also of using electrical network in embedding requests of virtual networks.

"Achieving security in distributed systems of constrained devices (like Wireless Sensor Networks) requires methods that can be performed while very limited computational, memory and communication resources are available. Moreover, while designing security protocols one needs take into account the adversary that can eavesdrop communication or compromise some of the devices. To achieve some level of security, two communicating devices need to establish a communication key. In the setting of severely constrained devices traditional methods are infeasible due to resource limitations, and one has to incorporate other security providing methods. One of the first such protocols has been introduced in Eschenauer and Gligor [24 The paper followed by dozens of others relies on probabilistic key sharing among the nodes before deployment (key predistribution) in the Ad Hoc environment. In our paper, we show that regular protocols of key predistribution designed primarily for providing confidentiality of communication do not provide privacy in many natural scenarios. More precisely, even a weak adversary may ""link"" transmissions of the same nodes. In particular even a passive adversary that is eavesdropping the communication can easily recognize whether the same devices start communication several times. Such information not only breaches nodes' privacy but also can be a starting point for an more advanced attacks and can give significant information about network's activity. We define several models of adversary and introduce some general methods that can be used for addressing this issue. For the model with weaker adversary we show how to fully secure the privacy in an efficient manner. For the case of stronger adversary, we propose a method based on local key exchange allowing mitigation of the privacy threat. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This aim was fulfilled by (1) using geostatistical analysis techniques to examine the extent of As contaminated groundwater in Prey Veng and identify a suitable study site, (2) conducting an on-site study in two villages to measure As content in cooked rice prepared with water collected from tubewells and locally harvested rainwater, and (3) determining the dietary intake of As from consuming this rice. Geostatistical analysis indicated that high risk tubewells (>50 mu g As/L) are concentrated along the Mekong River's east bank. Participants using high risk tubewells are consuming up to 24 times more inorganic As daily than recommended by the previous FAO/WHO provisional tolerable daily intake value (2.1 mu g/kgBW/day). However, As content in rice cooked in rainwater was significantly reduced, therefore, it is considered to be a safer and more sustainable option for this region.

One hundred and six extracts from 40 native Australian plant species traditionally used for the treatment of inflammation and/or to inhibit bacterial growth were investigated for their ability to inhibit the growth of a microbial trigger for ankylosing spondylitis (K. pneumoniae). Eighty-six of the extracts (81.1%) inhibited the growth of K. pneumoniae. The D. leichardtii, Eucalyptus spp., K. flavescens, Leptospermum spp., M. quinquenervia, Petalostigma spp., P. angustifolium, S. spinescens, S. australe, S. forte and Tasmannia spp. extracts were effective K. pneumoniae growth inhibitors, with MIC values generally < 1000 A mu g/mL. The T. lanceolata peppercorn extracts were the most potent growth inhibitors, with MIC values as low as 16 A mu g/mL. These extracts were examined by non-biased GC-MS headspace analysis and comparison with a compound database. A notable feature was the high relative abundance of the sesquiterpenoids polygodial, guaiol and caryophyllene oxide, and the monoterpenoids linalool, cineole and alpha-terpineol in the T. lanceolata peppercorn methanolic and aqueous extracts. The extracts with the most potent K. pneumoniae inhibitory activity (including the T. lanceolata peppercorn extracts) were nontoxic in the Artemia nauplii bioassay. The lack of toxicity and the growth inhibitory activity of these extracts against K. pneumoniae indicate their potential for both preventing the onset of ankylosing spondylitis and minimising its symptoms once the disease is established.

"A new full-precision algorithm to solve the Debye scattering equation has been developed for high-performance computing of powder diffraction line profiles from large-scale atomistic models of nanomaterials. The Debye function was evaluated using a pair distribution function computed with high accuracy, exploiting the series expansion of the error between calculated and equispace-sampled pair distances of atoms. The intensity uncertainty (standard deviation) of the computed diffraction profile was estimated as a function of the algorithm-intrinsic approximations and coordinate precision of the atomic positions, confirming the high accuracy of the simulated pattern. Based on the propagation of uncertainty, the new algorithm provides a more accurate powder diffraction profile than a brute-force calculation. Indeed, the precision of floating-point numbers employed in brute-force computations is worse than the estimated accuracy provided by the new algorithm. A software application, ROSE-X, has been implemented for parallel computing on CPU/GPU multi-core processors and distributed clusters. The computing performance is directly proportional to the total processor speed of the devices. An average speed of similar to 30 x 10(9) computed pair distances per second was measured, allowing simulation of the powder diffraction pattern of an similar to 23 million atom microstructure in a couple of hours. Moreover, the pair distribution function was recorded and reused to evaluate powder diffraction profiles of the same system with different properties (i.e. Q rather than 2 theta range, step and wavelength), avoiding additional pair distance computations. This approach was used to investigate a large collection of monoatomic and polyatomic microstructures, isolating the contribution from atoms belonging to different moieties (e.g. different species or crystalline domains).

"A series of coupled thermo-hydraulic simulations were performed on a soil-geotextile column to understand the effect of temperature on suction distribution throughout the soil column and on the hydraulic performance of the geotextile as a drainage/capillary barrier layer. Two different constant temperatures of 0 degrees C and 38 degrees C and a temperature gradient of 4 degrees C along the column were modeled. Changing the temperature from 0 degrees C to 38 degrees C did not have a significant effect on the suction head distribution in the soil-geotextile column. The temperature gradient resulted in appreciable thermal vapor flow and changes in suction head and hydraulic conductivity of the geotextile. During drainage, the temperature gradient and lower temperature at the top of the column increased suction in the geotextile and its ability to function as a capillary barrier. During capillary rise, the temperature gradient and lower temperature at the top of the column decreased the suction in the geotextile and its ability to function as a capillary barrier. Changing the direction of the thermal gradient reversed the water vapor flow direction and its effect on the suction in the geotextile. A temperature gradient did not have a noticeable effect on the suction head of the geotextile when positive pore pressure was developed in the geotextile and adjacent soil during drainage.

The ability of light beams to detect and traverse shallow water columns has provided valuable information about unmapped and often poorly understood coastal and inland water bodies of the world. Estimating ALB survey results at varying water clarity and depth conditions is essential for realizing project expectations and preparing budgets accordingly. In remote locations of the world where in situ water clarity measurements are not feasible or possible, using multiband satellite imagery can be an effective tool for estimating and addressing such considerations. For this purpose, we studied and classified reflected electromagnetic energy from selected water bodies acquired by RapidEye sensor and then correlated findings with ALB survey results. This study was focused not on accurately measuring depth from optical bathymetry but rather on using multiband satellite imagery to quickly predict ALB survey results and identify potentially turbid water bodies with limited depth penetration. For this study, we constructed an in-house algorithm to confirm ALB survey findings using bathymetric waveform information. The study findings are expected to contribute to the ongoing understanding of forecasting ALB survey expectations in unknown and varying water conditions, especially in remote and inaccessible parts of the world.

"(beta-amyloid (A beta) and tau pathology become increasingly prevalent with age, however, the spatial relationship between the two pathologies remains unknown. We examined local (same region) and non-local (different region) associations between these 2 aggregated proteins in 46 normal older adults using [F-18]AV-1451 (for tau) and [C-11]PiB (for A beta) positron emission tomography (PET) and 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. While local voxelwise analyses showed associations between PiB and AV-1451 tracer largely in the temporal lobes, k-means clustering revealed that some of these associations were driven by regions with low tracer retention. We followed this up with a whole-brain region-by-region (local and non-local) partial correlational analysis. We calculated each participant's mean AV-1451 and PiB uptake values within 87 regions of interest (ROI). Pairwise ROI analysis demonstrated many positive PiB AV-1451 associations. Importantly, strong positive partial correlations (controlling for age, sex, and global gray matter fraction, p <.01) were identified between PiB in multiple regions of association cortex and AV-1451 in temporal cortical ROIs. There were also less frequent and weaker positive associations of regional PiB with frontoparietal AV-1451 uptake. Particularly in temporal lobe ROIs, AV-1451 uptake was strongly predicted by NB across multiple ROI locations. These data indicate that A beta and tau pathology show significant local and non-local regional associations among cognitively normal elderly, with increased PiB uptake throughout the cortex correlating with increased temporal lobe AV-1451 uptake. The spatial relationship between A beta and tau accumulation does not appear to be specific to A beta location, suggesting a regional vulnerability of temporal brain regions to tau accumulation regardless of where AP accumulates.

"A new class of the all electric airship to globally transport both passengers and freight using a 'feeder-cruiser' concept, and powered by renewable electric energy, is considered. Specific focus is given to photo-electric harvesting as the primary energy source and the associated hydrogen-based energy storage systems. Furthermore, it is shown that the total PV output may be significantly increased by utilising cloud albedo effects. Appropriate power architectures and energy audits required for life support, and the propulsion and ancillary loads to support the continuous daily operation of the primary airship (cruiser) at stratospheric altitudes (circa 18 km), are also considered. The presented solution is substantially different from those of conventional aircraft due to the airship size and the inherent requirement to harvest and store sufficient energy during ""daylight"" operation, when subject to varying seasonal conditions and latitudes, to ensure its safe and continued operation during the corresponding varying ""dark hours"". This is particularly apparent when the sizing of the proposed electrolyser is considered, as its size and mass increase nonlinearly with decreasing day-night duty. As such, a Unitized Regenerative Fuel Cell is proposed. For the first time the study also discusses the potential benefits of integrating the photo-voltaic cells into airship canopy structures utilising TENSAIRITY (R)-based elements in order to eliminate the requirements for separate inter-PV array wiring and the transport of low pressure hydrogen between fuel cells.

"A randomized, controlled, parallel-group study was perform to compare the clinical efficacy of a semi-rigid bandage ('Scotchrap') with the standard adhesive tape treatment for ankle ligament injuries. The semi-rigid bandage support wrap consists of a knitted fibreglass fabric impregnated with a polyurethane resin. The cotton stockinet and the synthetic cast padding are used for protection of pressure points and any bony prominences. Prior to application, the 'Scotchrap' must be soaked in water after which it is applied in a way similar to that used for a plaster of paris bandage. The finished bandage remains elastic, allowing normal dorsal and plantar flexion of the foot, but preventing inversion and eversion, and pronation and supination. A t rest, the bandage always redresses the immobilized ankle into the neutral position, One hundred and thirty-six patients were included in the study. The semi-rigid bandage group comprised 59 patients and the tape group had 57 patients. These two groups were statistically comparable. The intake questionnaire included a general and a specific anamnesis form as well as a physical examination form. Follow-up data were recorded every 2 weeks. After termination of the treatment, the patients evaluated treatment efficacy. Statistical analysis of 126 items per patient with chi2-tests (p less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) and Fisher's exact tests (p less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) revealed no statistical significant differences in treatment result. The patient assessments of treatment efficacy of both types of bandage were also comparable. Both types of bandage gave sufficient stability (98%; p<0.005) and were equally effective. This study has shown that 'Scotchrap' can be used for lateral ankle ligament lesions with excellent short-term results. The technique for application of the 'Scotchrap' bandage is easy to learn, but must be considered thoroughly because any change in the technique will lead to changes in the rigidity of the bandage and early wastage. The semi-rigid bandage can also be used for the functional treatment of patients who are allergic to tape. Of more interest are the other fields of application in which this new material can be used, e.g. orthopaedic corsets, after-treatment for knee arthroscopies, achilles tendon ruptures, or even for wrist fractures. It is concluded that, alone or in combination with other cast-immobilization techniques, the semi-rigid 'Scotchrap' bandage represents a welcome and useful contribution to the existing assortment of bandage materials.

"A human biomonitoring (HBM) survey in four areas affected by natural or anthropogenic arsenic pollution was conducted in Italy within the framework of the SEpiAs project. A questionnaire, including the exploration of risk perception (RP) regarding environmental hazards and access to and trust in information, was administered to 282 subjects stratified by area, gender and age. The survey was designed to investigate how populations living in polluted areas could adopt prevention-oriented habits, fostered by the awareness of existing risks and, in addition, how increased knowledge of RP and information flows could support researchers in identifying recommendations, and presenting and disseminating HBM results. This study characterizes the four areas in terms of RP and access to and trust in environmental information, and provides insights into the influence of RP and environmental information on food consumption. For the data analysis, a combined random forest (RF) and logistic regression approach was carried out. RF was applied to the variables derived from the questionnaire in order to identify the most important in terms of the aims defined. Associations were then tested using Fisher's exact test and assessed with logistic regression in order to adjust for confounders. Results showed that the perception of and personal exposure to atmospheric and water pollution, hazardous industries and waste, hazardous material transportation and waste was higher in geographical areas characterized by anthropogenic pollution. Citizens living in industrial areas appeared to be aware of environmental risks and had more confidence in environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) than in public authorities. In addition, they reported an insufficient circulation of information. Concerning the influence of RP and environmental information on food consumption, a high perception of personal exposure to atmospheric pollution and hazardous industries was associated with a lower consumption of local fish. In conclusion, different RPs and information flow patterns were observed in areas with arsenic of natural origin or in industrial contexts. These findings may be useful for targeted risk communication plans in support of risk management strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"A novel proportional-integral-derivative-based fuzzy neural network (PID-based FNN) controller is proposed in this study to control the speed of a vane-type air motor (VAM) servo system for tracking periodic speed command. First, the structure and operating principles of the VAM servo system are introduced. Then, the dynamics of the VAM servo system is analyzed to derive the second-order state equation of the VAM. Moreover, due to the dynamic characteristics and system parameters of the VAM servo system are highly nonlinear and time-varying, a PID-based FNN controller, which integrates conventional proportional-integral-derivative neural network (PIDNN) control with fuzzy rules, is proposed to achieve precise speed control of VAM servo system under the occurrences of the inherent nonlinearities and external disturbances. The network structure and its on-line learning algorithm using delta adaptation law are described in detail. Meanwhile, the convergence analysis of the speed tracking error is given using the discrete-type Lyapunov function. To enhance the control performance of the proposed intelligent control approach, a 32-bit floating-point digital signal processor (DSP), TMS320F28335, is adopted for the implementation of the proposed control system. Finally, experimental results are illustrated to show the validity and advantages of the proposed PID-based FNN controller for VAM servo system.

"A constant tension towing winch maintains constant towing rope tension between the cable ship and the cable laying machine. In this paper, an active constant tension controller based upon a hybrid FUZZY P+ID strategy is proposed to improve the performance yield of the conventional PID controller that was implemented on the towing winch. The FUZZY P+ID controller replaces the P item of the conventional PID with the FUZZY P item, but the I and D items remain unchanged. The comparative studies of the FUZZY P+ID and traditional PID controllers were conducted, and the numerical simulation results show that the performance of the proposed FUZZY P+ID controller is superior to that of the PID controller. The proposed FUZZY P+ID controller was implemented in the constant tension towing winch to substitute for the existing PID controller. The real applications for driving the submarine cable laying ship under harsh undersea conditions demonstrated the robustness of the FUZZY P+ID for a number of unmeasurable disturbances, such as the buoyancy, the drag force, and wave effects.

"AES algorithm or Rijndael algorithm is a network security algorithm which is most commonly used in all types of wired and wireless digital communication networks for secure transmission of data between two end users, especially over a public network. This paper presents the hardware implementation of AES Rijndael Encryption and Decryption Algorithm by using Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA. The hardware design approach is entirely based on pre-calculated look-up tables (LUTs) which results in less complex architecture, thereby providing high throughput and low latency. There are basically three different formats in AES. They are AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256. The encryption and decryption blocks of all the three formats are efficiently designed by using Verilog-HDL and are synthesized on Virtex-7 XC7VX690T chip (Target Device) with the help of Xilinx ISE Design Suite-14.7 Tool. The synthesis tool was set to optimize speed, area and power. The power analysis is made by using Xilinx XPower Analyzer. Pre-calculated LUTs are used for the implementation of algorithmic functions, namely S-Box and Inverse S-Box transformations and also for GF (28) i. e. Galois Field Multiplications involved in Mix-Columns and Inverse Mix-Columns transformations. The proposed architecture is found to be having good efficiency in terms of latency, throughput, speed/delay, area and power.

"A large number of computer applications(like Computer Graphics, Control Systems, Modeling System, Simulators etc.) needed floating point arithmetic. However, most of the presently available methods are slow and inefficient because of sequential design however the recent development in the field of programmable logic devices such as FPLA and CPLD opens the new area of parallel and high speed floating point designs. Considering that the synchronous architectures requires that that all clock events happen at the same time over the complete circuit which it not possible due to clock skew also the latency and throughput of the circuit are directly linked to the worst-case delay of the slowest element which increases the delay. Hence this paper presents self-timed carry look ahead adder based implementation of IEEE 754 32 bit floating point multiplier for FPGA devices. The simulation results shows that the proposed design has lower latency than synchronous design as well as lower power requirements.

This circuit configuration allows for reiterative sample, integrate and reset. A sampling technique is given to remove Johnson noise, enabling a femtoampere level readout noise performance. Commercial-off-the-shelf acquisition electronics are used to digitize the preamplifier analog signals. The data logging acquisition electronics has a different integration circuit, which allows the bandwidth and gain to be independently adjusted.

"Application of fuzzy rule interpolation (FRI) has been escalating for making intelligent systems viable in many areas. However, requirements of such systems may change over time and the supporting static rule base may not be able to provide accurate interpolation results in the long run. Dynamic fuzzy rule interpolation (D-FRI) is one of the potential solutions for this problem, a such has been developed in the last few years to fulfil the requirements of dynamic and pertinent rule bases for intelligent systems. Nevertheless, applications of the proposed D-FRI approach need further investigation. One potential application is for network security that is one of the biggest concerns of any organisation irrespective of their size and nature of business. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are considered as one of the most popular and effective security tools for generating alerts to systems or network administrators to inform possible or existing threats. A standard IDS may not be very effective or even unsuitable for an organisational or individual's requirements. This paper presents an application of D-FRI for building an effective IDS. In this implementation, the most popular open source IDS, Snort is used and the resultant intelligent IDS is named D-FRI-Snort. Experimental analysis shows that the integration of D-FRI with the IDS Snort provides an additional level of intelligence to predict the level/sensitivity of possible threats. It also provides a dynamic rule base by promoting new rules based on the current network traffic conditions, which helps Snort to reduce both false positives and false negatives.

"Aim : The aim of this research was to evaluate if leaf removal and red geotextile reflective mulch ""Vitexsol"" could affect phenolic composition of wines from three white cultivars, Riesling italico, Traminer, and Manzoni bianco. Methods and results: A two-year study was conducted to evaluate the effects of leaf removal and reflective mulch on the phenolic composition of white wines from Zagreb vineyards in northwestern Croatia. Leaf removal (LR) and reflective mulch (RM) ""Vitexsol"", made from weave of aluminum platelets protected by a transparent film and sewn together with red polypropylene threads, were tested separately and combined (LR + RM) on vines of Traminer, Riesling italico and Manzoni bianco in 2008 and 2009. LR and RM had no consistent effect on must sugar content and titratable acidity. All treatments resulted in higher total phenol and flavan-3-ol content in wines of all cultivars, but in different years. LR + RM generally resulted in the highest phenolic acid and individual flavan-3-ol content in all wines except Traminer. RM treatment had the least effect on phenolic composition of wines. Conclusion: LR + RM generally resulted in the highest content of most phenolic compounds, especially when compared to control wines. Significance and impact of the study: This work provides some useful informations for adjusting vineyard practices and thus optimizing phenolic quality of white wines.

"A Summary The majority of patients do not receive anti-osteoporotic treatment following a major osteoporotic fracture, despite the guidelines and the availability of effective anti-osteoporotic treatments. The fight against factors limiting the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis should become a priority to improve secondary prevention after an initial osteoporotic fracture. Purpose Despite the availability of effective anti-osteoporotic treatments, osteoporosis management is currently insufficient. The main objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of anti-osteoporotic treatments introduced after an initial prior major osteoporotic fracture during hospitalization for recurring fractures. Methods We conducted an observational, cross-sectional, bicentric study that included all patients aged over 50 years who were hospitalized or seen in consultation for major osteoporotic fracture. Results One hundred twenty-eight out of two hundred four (62.7%) patients had a past history of major osteoporotic fracture and therefore had an indication of treatment based on guidelines. Among these patients, only 43/128 (33.5%) had received anti-osteoporotic treatment as secondary prevention after the initial fracture. The main causes of non-prescription identified were the attending physicians' ignorance of the indication of treatment (n = 30; 35.3%), ignorance of the fracture (n = 17; 20%), and comorbidities (n = 12; 14.1%). The failure to introduce treatment was associated with the presence of comorbidities with a Charlson Comorbidity Index = 6 (OR = 0.34 [0.16-0.73], p < 0.05), dementia (OR = 0.23 [0.08-0.72], p < 0.05), and past history of proximal femur fracture (OR = 0.20 [0.04-0.91], p < 0.05). Conclusions Two thirds of patients with a past history of major osteoporotic fracture presenting with a new fracture were not treated. The main reason for lack of treatment seems to stem from the incorrect assessment of the patient's fracture risk. Although major osteoporotic fracture leads to an increased risk of mortality and requires treatment, the significance of patient comorbidities was an independent risk factor leading to non-treatment.

"An analysis framework for vehicle-bridge dynamic interaction system under turbulent wind is proposed based on the relevant theory of wind engineering and dynamics. Considering the fluctuating properties of wind field, the stochastic wind velocity time history is simulated by the Auto-Regressive method in terms of power spectral density function of wind field. The bridge is represented by three-dimensional finite element model and the vehicle by a multi-rigid-body system connected by springs and dashpots. The detailed calculation formulas of unsteady aerodynamic forces on bridge and vehicle are derived. In addition, the form selection of wind barriers, which are applied as the windbreak measures of newly-built railways in northwest China, is studied based on the suggested evaluation index, and the suitable values about height and porosity rate of wind barriers are studied. By taking a multi-span simply-supported box-girder bridge as a case study, the dynamic response of the bridge and the running safety indices of the train traveling on the bridge with and without wind barriers are calculated. The limit values of train speed with respect to different wind velocities are proposed according to the allowance values in the design code.

"Ambient Intelligence promises to transform current spaces into electronic environments that are responsive, assistive and sensitive to human presence. Those electronic environments will be fully populated with dozens, hundreds or even thousands of connected devices that share information and thus become intelligent. That massive wave of electronic devices will also invade everyday objects, turning them into smart entities, keeping their native features and characteristics while seamlessly promoting them to a new class of thinking and reasoning everyday objects. Although there are strong expectations that most of the users' needs can be fulfilled without their intervention, there are still situations where interaction is required. This paper presents work being done in the field of human-computer interaction, focusing on smart home environments, while being a part of a larger project called Aging Inside a Smart Home. This initiative arose as a way to deal with a large scourge of our country, where lots of elderly persons live alone in their homes, often with limited or no physical mobility. The project relies on the mobile agent computing paradigm in order to create a Virtual Butler that provides the interface between the elderly and the smart home infrastructure. The Virtual Butler is receptive to user questions, answering them according to the context and knowledge of the AISH. It is also capable of interacting with the user whenever it senses that something has gone wrong, notifying next of kin and/or medical services, etc. The Virtual Butler is aware of the user location and moves to the computing device which is closest to the user, in order to be always present. Its avatar can also run in handheld devices keeping its main functionality in order to track user when s/he goes out. According to the evaluation carried out, the Virtual Butler is assessed as a very interesting and loved digital friend, filling the gap between the user and the smart home. The evaluation also showed that the Virtual Butler concept can be easily ported to other types of possible smart and assistive environments like airports, hospitals, shopping malls, offices, etc.

"A model to predict the motor temperature of an electrical submersible pump (ESP), under variable conditions of flow rate and loading, has been developed. This model takes into account the coupled behavior between motor, pump and production system. Thus, given a defined frequency in the variable speed drive, the motor temperature was determined as a result of the equilibrium between the heat generation, calculated from the power that the pump demands from the motor, and the heat extraction resistance, calculated from the production flow rate around the motor. Furthermore, in real field operations, the measurement of the motor temperature is made at the lower end of the stator winding, which is not exactly the maximum temperature point. In order to predict the maximum motor temperature value, the model developed in this work determines the motor temperature distribution. A convective heat transfer study has also been made comparing models based on fully developed temperature profile to models that consider the development of the thermal boundary layer. A case study has been made with several oil viscosities and water cut. The results showed a fact commonly observed in ESP field operations, that is, the motor temperature rises when the motor speed is continuously increased. It was also shown that neglecting the effect of the thermal boundary layer development may result in an overheated motor prediction where actually, the motor maximum temperature is much lower than its upper limit. Thus, it was observed that fully developed temperature profile models suffer from inaccuracy when used in viscous oil applications, because of their great thermal entry length. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"A ground surface roughness measurement method is proposed to address current problems in the use of machine vision technology to measure roughness: the calculations are complex, and the measurement process is largely affected by the light source.

Red and green color space-based color distribution statistical matrices, as well as corresponding overlap indices, are proposed. A relationship model between overlap index and roughness is constructed. The effect of light source brightness and texture direction on the relationship model is discussed based on the experimental data. The results demonstrate that the surface roughness measurement method, which is based on the overlap degree of the color image, has relatively high accuracy and a relatively wide measurement range and is, to a certain degree, robust to the brightness of the light source and the texture direction.

"As an important regulator of pollutants in overland flow and interflow, land use has become an essential research component for determining the relationships between surface water quality and pollution sources. This study investigated the use of ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models to identify the impact of land use and population density on surface water quality in the Wen-Rui Tang River watershed of eastern China. A manual variable excluding-selecting method was explored to resolve multicollinearity issues. Standard regression coefficient analysis coupled with cluster analysis was introduced to determine which variable had the greatest influence on water quality. Results showed that: (1) Impact of land use on water quality varied with spatial and seasonal scales. Both positive and negative effects for certain land-use indicators were found in different subcatchments. (2) Urban land was the dominant factor influencing N, P and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in highly urbanized regions, but the relationship was weak as the pollutants were mainly from point sources. Agricultural land was the primary factor influencing N and P in suburban and rural areas; the relationship was strong as the pollutants were mainly from agricultural surface runoff. Subcatchments located in suburban areas were identified with urban land as the primary influencing factor during the wet season while agricultural land was identified as a more prevalent influencing factor during the dry season. (3) Adjusted R-2 values in OLS models using the manual variable excluding-selecting method averaged 14.3% higher than using stepwise multiple linear regressions. However, the corresponding GWR models had adjusted R-2 similar to 59.2% higher than the optimal OLS models, confirming that GWR models demonstrated better prediction accuracy. Based on our findings, water resource protection policies should consider site-specific land-use conditions within each watershed to optimize mitigation strategies for contrasting land-use characteristics and seasonal variations.

"Aim Less than 6% of the worlds described plant species have been assessed on the IUCN Red List, leaving many species invisible to conservation prioritization. Large-scale Red List assessment of plant species is a challenge, as most species' ranges have only been resolved to a coarse scale. As geographic distribution is a key assessment criterion on the IUCN Red List, we evaluate the use of coarse-scale distribution data in predictive models to assess the global scale and drivers of extinction risk in an economically important plant group, the bulbous monocotyledons. Location Global. Methods Using coarse-scale species distribution data, we train a machine learning model on biological and environmental variables for 148 species assessed on the IUCN Red List in order to identify correlates of extinction risk. We predict the extinction risk of 6439 'bulbous monocot' species with the best of 13 models and map our predictions to identify potential hotspots of threat. Results Our model achieved 91% classification accuracy, with 88% of threatened species and 93% of non-threatened species accurately predicted. The model predicted 35% of bulbous monocots presently 'Not Evaluated' under IUCN criteria to be threatened and human impacts were a key correlate of threat. Spatial analysis identified some hotspots of threat where no bulbous monocots are yet on the IUCN Red List, for example central Chile. Main conclusions This is the first time a machine learning model has been used to determine extinction risk at a global scale in a species-rich plant group. As coarse-scale distribution data exist for many plant groups, our methods can be replicated to provide extinction risk predictions across the plant kingdom. Our approach can be used as a low-cost prioritization tool for targeting field based assessments.

"A critical aspect of dimensionality reduction is to assess the quality of selected (or produced) feature subsets properly. Feature subset assessment in machine learning refers to split a given feature subset into a training set, which is used to estimate the parameters of a classification model, and a test set used to estimate the predictive performance of the model. Then, averaging the results of multiple splitting (i.e., Cross-Validation, CV) is commonly used to decrease the variance of the estimator. But in practice, CV scheme is very computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a new statistics index method called LW-index for evaluation of feature subset and dimensionality reduction algorithms in general. The proposed method is a type of ""classical statistics"" approach that uses the feature subset to compute an empirical estimate of the quality of feature subset. A large number of performance comparisons with the machine learning approach conducted on fourteen benchmark collections show that the proposed LW index is highly correlated with the external indices (i.e., MacroF(1), MicroF(1)) of SVM and Centroid-Based Classifier (CBC) trained by five-fold CV scheme. Furthermore, the experimental results indicate that LW index has the same performance as the traditional CV scheme for evaluating the dimensionality reduction algorithms and it is more efficient than the traditional methodology. Therefore, one contribution of this paper is to present an alternative methodology, based on an internal index typically used in the unsupervised learning context, that is computationally cheaper than the traditional CV methodology. Another contribution is to propose a new internal index that behaves better than other similar indices widely used in clustering and shows high correlation with the results obtained by the traditional methodology.

"According to developmental niche theory, members of different cultural and ethnic groups often have distinct ideas about what children need to become well-adapted adults. These beliefs are reflected in parents' long-term socialization goals for their children. In this study, we test whether specific themes that have been deemed important in literature on diverse families in the United States (e.g., Strong Black Woman [SBW], marianismo, familismo) are evident in mothers' long-term socialization goals. Participants included 192 mothers of teenage daughters from a low-income city in the United States (58% Latina, 22% African American, and 20% European American [EA]/White). Socialization goals were assessed through a q-sort task on important traits for a woman to possess and content analysis of open-ended responses about what values mothers hoped they would transmit to their daughters as they become adults. Results from ANCOVAs and logistic regression indicate significant racial/ethnic differences on both tasks consistent with hypotheses. On the q-sort task, African American mothers put more importance on women possessing traits such as independence than mothers from other racial/ethnic groups. Similarly, they were more likely to emphasize self-confidence and strength in what they hoped to transmit to their daughters. Contrary to expectation, Latina mothers did not emphasize social traits on the q-sort; however, in open-ended responses, they were more likely to focus on the importance of motherhood, one aspect of marianismo and familismo. Overall, results suggest that these mothers' long-term socialization goals incorporate culturally relevant values considered important for African American and Latino families.

"A total of 211 water samples were collected from 53 key sampling points from 5-10th July 2013 at four different depths (0 m, 2 m, 4 m, 8 m) and at different sites in the Huaihe River, Anhui, China. These points monitored for 18 parameters (water temperature, pH, TN, TP, TOC, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Co, Cr, Cd, Mn, B, Fe, Al, Mg, and Ba). The spatial variability, contamination sources and health risk of trace elements as well as the river Water quality were investigated. Our results were compared with national (CSEPA) and international (WHO, USEPA) drinking water guidelines, revealing that Zn, Cd and Pb were the dominant pollutants in the water body. Application of different multivariate statistical approaches, including correlation matrix and factor/principal component analysis (FA/PCA), to assess the origins of the elements in the Huaihe River, identified three source types that accounted for 79.31% of the total variance. Anthropogenic activities were considered to contribute Much of the Zn, Cd, Pb, Ni, Co, and Mn via industrial waste, coal combustion, and vehicle exhaust; Ba, B, Cr and Cu were controlled by mixed anthropogenic and natural sources, and Mg, Fe and Al had natural origins from weathered rocks and crustal materials. Cluster analysis (CA) was used to classify the 53 sample points into three groups of water pollution, high pollution, moderate pollution, and low pollution, reflecting influences from tributaries, power plants and vehicle exhaust, and agricultural activities, respectively. The results of the water quality index (WO) indicate that Water in the Huaihe River is heavily polluted by trace elements, so approximately 96% of the water in the Huaihe River is unsuitable for drinking. A health risk assessment using the hazard quotient and index (HQ/HI) recommended by the USEPA suggests that Co, Cd and Pb in the river could cause non-carcinogenic harm to human health.

"A poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanocom-posite incorporated with polydopamine-coated reduced graphene oxide (rGO@PDOPA) nanosheets has been developed with high dielectric permittivity and low loss for electricity storage applications. Structural analysis indicates that PDOPA was successfully anchored onto rGOs through non-covalent linkage under mild conditions. The presence of PDOPA layer between rGO and PVDF can not only prevent the agglomeration and direct contact of original rGOs but also enhance the interaction between PVDF and rGO and microcapacitor formation. Compared to rGO/PVDF composites, higher dielectric permittivity and lower loss factor were achieved simultaneously in rGO@PDOPA/PVDF nanocomposites at low and moderate frequencies. The PDOPA interface layers are effective in modifying the dielectric characteristics of the composites to increase the dielectric permittivity without the introduction of loss mechanisms. This study demonstrates that PDOPA is an ideal interface layer for the development of new percolative dielectric composites with high dielectric permittivity and low loss.

"A substantial amount of datasets stored for various applications are often high dimensional with redundant and irrelevant features. Processing and analysing data under such circumstances is time consuming and makes it difficult to obtain efficient predictive models. There is a strong need to carry out analyses for high dimensional data in some lower dimensions, and one approach to achieve this is through feature selection. This paper presents a new relevancy-redundancy approach, called the maximum relevance minimum multicollinearity (MRmMC) method, for feature selection and ranking, which can overcome some shortcomings of existing criteria. In the proposed method, relevant features are measured by correlation characteristics based on conditional variance while redundancy elimination is achieved according to multiple correlation assessment using an orthogonal projection scheme. A series of experiments were conducted on eight datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and results show that the proposed method performed reasonably well for feature subset selection.

"A passive rainwater harvesting technique was used to design a sustainable landscape for a residential lot located in the desert. The design was adapted to the Desert Southwest region of the United States based on thirty years of daily historical climate data including precipitation and reference evapotranspiration (ET0). Four cities including El Paso, TX, Albuquerque, NM, Phoenix, AZ, and Pahrump, NV, were selected to represent the area. The residential lot was broken up into micro-watersheds reflecting the runoff of water from each separate portion of the house roof, driveway, and lawn area. The paper explains in detail the design steps for one of the micro-watersheds where water retention and infiltration structures were distributed throughout the soil area to capture stormwater runoff close to its source. A passive rainwater capture landscape was obtained by using the stormwater captured in the infiltration structures and stored in the surrounding soil. Native vegetation (shrubs and trees) will use this water exclusively for growth. These plants will not require watering once their root establishment period has passed, except in extreme droughts. Meanwhile, stormwater discharge from the lot will decrease and the groundwater recharge will increase. Results indicate that the current urban water budget can be made sustainable by replacing watering of landscape by municipal water with harvested stormwater. This results in a relatively lush and shady environment even in desert climates. The success is an artifact of the tendency of urban watersheds to increase the volume of stormwater relative to pre-development conditions.

"A constrained output feedback model predictive control approach for nonlinear systems is presented in this paper. The state variables are observed using an unscented Kalman filter, which offers some advantages over an extended Kalman filter. A nonlinear dynamic model of the system, considered in this investigation, is developed considering all possible effective elements. The model is then adaptively linearized along the prediction horizon using a state-dependent state space representation. In order to improve the performance of the control system as many linearized models as the number of prediction horizons are obtained at each sample time. The optimum results of the previous sample time are utilized for linearization at the current sample time. Subsequently, a linear quadratic objective function with constraints is formulated using the developed governing equations of the plant. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed control approach is validated both in simulation and through real-time experimentation using a constrained highly nonlinear aerodynamic test rig, a twin rotor MIMO system (TRMS).

"A real-time dynamic hardware-in-loop (HIL) simulator of an RTX real-time subsystem (RTSS) was developed by using LabVIEW (G language). The main idea of this work was to determine the feasibility and accuracy of widely available and highly competitive commercial products, such as personal computers on an RTSS, as an alternative to conventional prohibitive real-time simulators in dynamic studies of power systems. The implemented system is a self-contained heavy-duty gas turbine, governor, synchronous 200-MVA, 15.75-kV machine and a simplified electrical network. The HIL simulator was customized to interact with a 1518-kW static exciter. The role of this HIL simulator is to provide real-time digital and analog signals for static exciter systems (SES) and to simulate the mechanical and electrical components in a closed-loop, fixed-step solver applied by a well-known numerical solution method. This sophisticated yet exceptionally economic HIL simulator provides engineers with a safe environment to analyze the dynamic performance of static exciters and investigate their natural restraints and functionalities.

"According to international recommendations, the selection of the biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is mainly left to the clinician's preference. We analyzed the real-life factors influencing the first-line choice or the switching strategy, focusing on the prescription of abatacept (ABA) or tocilizumab (TCZ) compared to TNF alpha inhibitors (TNFi). Patients enrolled in the Lombardy Rheumatology Network (LORHEN) Registry after January 1, 2010, when all considered bDMARD agents were available, were included. The population was divided into ""first-"" and ""second-line"" bDMARD. We included 1910 patients (first line n = 1264, second line n = 646). Age was higher in ABA or TCZ vs TNFi treated patients (p < 0.0001). Positive latent tuberculosis screening was associated with first-line ABA (p = 0.002). Methotrexate (MTX) combination therapy was lower in the TCZ group (p = 0.02). The type (dyslipidemia, hypertension, pulmonary disease) and the number of comorbidities influenced the choice towards ABA (p = 0.01). Multinomial logistic regression demonstrated that a second-line treatment, higher age, dyslipidemia, pulmonary disease, other comorbidities, and extra-articular RA manifestations were associated with ABA compared to TNFi. TCZ was associated with a second-line treatment, higher age, and more severe disease activity. Stopping the first bDMARD due to adverse events (AE) influenced the choice towards ABA. In real life, higher age and comorbidities influence the choice towards ABA and TCZ compared to TNFi. ABA was preferred in case of suspension of previous treatments due to AE. After failing a first-line TNFi, swapping to a different mechanism of action is more common.

"A number of resistive switching memories exhibit activation-based dynamical behavior, which makes them suitable for neuromorphic and programmable analog filtering applications. Because the Boundary Condition Memristor (BCM) model accounts for tunable activation thresholds only at the on and off boundary states, it is not quantitatively accurate in the description of these kinds of memristors and in the investigation of their circuit applications. This paper introduces the Generalized Boundary Condition Memristor (GBCM) model, preserving the features of the BCM model while allowing, further, an ad-hoc tuning of activation-based dynamics, which enables an appropriate modulation of the conditions under which memristors may operate as storage elements or data processors. A simple circuit implementation of the novel model is presented, and time-efficient simulations confirming the improvement in modeling accuracy over the BCM model are shown. As a proof-of-concept for the suitability of the GBCM model in the exploration of the full potential of memristors in neuromorphic circuits and programmable analog filters, this paper adopts it to model fundamental synaptic rules governing the mechanisms of learning in neural systems and to gain some insight into key issues in the design of a couple of filters.

Due to this, all 273 19683 switching states are to be considered. The result of the MPC strategy is, compared to classical control, a drastic reduction of the commutation frequency and respectively the converter losses. However, besides the advantages there are still some problems with the use of MPC for thyristor matrix converter. Therefor this contribution presents extensions of the standard direct model predictive control strategy to overcome these problems. The result is a predictive control structure with a fallback level for problematic working areas. By this, a low total harmonic distortion (THD) as well as a high efficiency can be achieved.

"Ambient Intelligence is the next wave in computing and communication technology. Nano-sensors, wireless networks and unified intelligent software are the main elements of this issue. Inputs of ambient intelligence are taken from sensors in the environment. Wireless sensor networks consists of small and low cost sensors that collect and report environmental data. Wireless sensors are dispersed in an area that some phenomenon or event should be monitored. When a sensor detects the monitored event (heat, pressure, sound, light, areas having magnetic properties, vibration, etc.), the event is reported to one of the sites. This site performs an appropriate task such as sending a message or local processing based on the type of network, and then provides the appropriate response. One of the major challenges in wireless sensor networks is optimizing the energy consumption. Studies have shown that by clustering network nodes, it is possible to use their energy more efficiently. This study proposes a clustering based routing method to be used in wireless sensor networks. Multi-objective optimization algorithm named as Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II is used for clustering and seven objective functions are described. It is aimed to carry out several goals at once by using multi objective algorithm. While communication cost between the objective functions and cluster-head and Sink, and cluster-head and non-cluster-head is tried to be minimized, selection of the cluster heads only from the nodes near Sink is also tried to be prevented and it is also taken into consideration for clusters to include more nodes as much as possible. Each solution of the solution set obtained with Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II points a different network topology. Each solution in solution set is the best solution according to some of objective functions. It is provided that Sink simulate each solution in solution set according to a certain scenario and choose one suitable for the desired criteria. In proposed method, both operating the Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II and, simulation and evaluation of the obtained solutions comes out in Sink which has sufficient operation and power sources. According to the results, the proposed method can make the life span of network five times longer than LEACH, which is the most famous clustering algorithm. Besides, while the proposed method extends the life span of network, it is also seen that it increases the number of the packet reaching Sink two times more than LEACH. The data provided by proposed method includes information about larger areas when compared to LEACH. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"A 40-nm microcontroller featuring voltage stacked memory and logic is presented. This involved connecting the power domains of the memory and logic in series, such that the ground of one power domain is connected to the positive supply rail of the other. In this paper, an ARM Cortex-M0+ and its peripherals are powered from 0 V to V-DD, while its 4-kB ROM and the 16-kB SRAM are powered from V-DD to 2 V-DD. Since the memory and logic will, in general, draw different supply currents, the midrail V-DD is provided by an on-chip switched capacitor voltage regulator (SCVR). To allow a direct comparison of voltage stacking with a conventional single supply, it can be turned off by configuring the SCVR to power both the memory and logic from 0 V and V-DD. Turning on voltage stacking results in 96% power conversion efficiency, while the active converter area is reduced by 2.6x. Despite the use of a smaller SCVR, the voltage stacking reduces the supply noise by 3.4 dB and the output voltage drops from 58 to 36 mV.

Although basic mechanisms of its origin and development are known, some important steps in this process are still waiting for more detailed explanation. Therefore, in addition to already proved aggressive lowering of LDL cholesterol, appropriate timing of atherosclerosis treatment is of the essence. Revealing different stages of atherosclerotic process, less or more sensitive to treatment is of primary importance; however, its detection is complicated by several facts including not exactly identifiable periods of quiescence and progression of atherosclerotic process.

Now, it is supposed to be favorable in women soon, approximately less than 8 years, after menopause. In addition, the same principle - optimal timing of the intervention of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, especially lipids, could be also of importance.

As a result, the native flora and fauna have been displaced, important habitats have been lost, invasive species have become prevalent, and water contaminant concentrations have increased. Accelerating efforts are being made towards preserving the Everglades ecosystem by restoring water flow and improving water quality.

"Age-and menopause-related impairment in working memory mediated by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) occurs in humans and nonhuman primates. Long-term cyclic 17 beta-estradiol treatment rescues cognitive deficits in aged ovariectomized rhesus monkeys while restoring highly plastic synapses. Here we tested whether distributions of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) within monkey layer III dlPFC synapses are sensitive to age and estradiol, and coupled to cognitive function. Ovariectomized young and aged monkeys administered vehicle or estradiol were first tested on a delayed response test of working memory. Then, quantitative serial section immunoelectron microscopy was used to determine the distributions of synaptic GPER1. GPER1-containing nonperforated axospinous synapse density was reduced with age, and partially restored with estrogen treatment. The majority of synapses expressed GPER1, which was predominately localized to presynaptic cytoplasm and mitochondria. GPER1 was also abundant at plasmalemmas, and within cytoplasmic and postsynaptic density (PSD) domains of dendritic spines. GPER1 levels did not differ with age or treatment, and none of the variables examined were tightly associated with cognitive function. However, greater representation of GPER1 subjacent to the PSD accompanied higher synapse density. These data suggest that GPER1 is positioned to support diverse functions key to synaptic plasticity in monkey dlPFC.

"A moisturizing cream mixed with a steroid ointment is frequently prescribed to patients suffering from atopic dermatitis. However, there is a concern that the mixing operation causes destabilization. The present study was performed to investigate the stability of such preparations closely using magnetic resonance imaging (MR1). As sample preparations, five commercial moisturizing creams that are popular in Japan were mixed with an ointment base, a white petrolatum, at a volume ratio of 1:1. The mixed preparations were stored at 60 degrees C to accelerate the destabilization processes. Subsequently, the phase separations induced by the storage test were monitored using MR1. Using advanced MR technologies including spin spin relaxation time (T-2) mapping and MR spectroscopy, we successfully characterized the phase-separation behavior of the test samples. For most samples, phase separations developed by the bleeding of liquid oil components. From a sample consisting of an oil-in-water-type cream, Urepearl Cream 10%, a distinct phase-separation mode was observed, which was initiated by the aqueous component separating from the bottom part of the sample. The resultant phase separation was the most distinct among the test samples. To investigate the phase separation quantitatively and objectively, we conducted a histogram analysis on the acquired T-2 maps. The water-in-oil type creams were found to be much more stable after mixing with ointment base than those of oil-in-water type creams. This finding strongly supported the validity of the mixing operation traditionally conducted in pharmacies.

"Advances in our understanding of the human pain experience have shifted much of the focus of pain research from the periphery to the brain. Current hypotheses suggest that the progression of migraine depends on abnormal functioning of neurons in multiple brain regions. Accordingly, we sought to capture functional brain changes induced by the application of an inflammatory cocktail known as inflammatory soup (IS), to the dura mater across multiple brain networks. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether IS alters additional neural networks indirectly related to the primary nociceptive pathways via the spinal cord to the thalamus and cortex. IS comprises an acidic combination of bradykinin, serotonin, histamine and prostaglandin PGE2 and was introduced to basic pain research as a tool to activate and sensitize peripheral nociceptors when studying pathological pain conditions associated with allodynia and hyperalgesia. Using this model of intracranial pain, we found that dural application of IS in awake, fully conscious, rats enhanced thalamic, hypothalamic, hippocampal and somatosensory cortex responses to mechanical stimulation of the face (compared to sham synthetic interstitial fluid administration). Furthermore, resting state MRI data revealed altered functional connectivity in a number of networks previously identified in clinical chronic pain populations. These included the default mode, sensorimotor, interoceptive (Salience) and autonomic networks. The findings suggest that activation and sensitization of meningeal nociceptors by IS can enhance the extent to which the brain processes nociceptive signaling, define new level of modulation of affective and cognitive responses to pain; set new tone for hypothalamic regulation of autonomic outflow to the cranium; and change cerebellar functions.

For this purpose we developed an open-source Fibril) plugin for the ImageJ/FiJi program. It automatically recognizes the fibrils on the surface of a mica, silicon, gold or formvar film and further analyzes them to calculate the distribution of fibrils by diameters, lengths and persistence lengths. The plugin has been validated by the processing of TEM images of fibrils formed by Sup35NM yeast protein and artificially created images of rod-shape objects with predefined parameters. Novel data obtained by SEM for Sup35NM protein fibrils immobilized on silicon and gold substrates are also presented and analyzed. Program summary Program title: FibrilJ Program Files doi: http://dx.doLorg/10.17632/ndxb93h4vc.1 Licensing provisions: Apache-2.0 Programming language: ImageJ Macro Language Nature of problem: Amyloids are large protein aggregates that form Unbranched fibrils. Formation of amyloids by different proteins leads to the emergence of a number of serious human diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. Therefore, various amyloids, in particular their topology, are widely studied in an enormous number of papers. The structural organization of the amyloid aggregates at the molecular level is a key problem in this area. At the moment new methods of amyloids analysis based on electronic and probe microscopy are particularly popular. Usually it is required to process images containing hundreds of amyloids to obtain statistically reliable data on the distribution of the thickness, length and persistence length (a basic mechanical property quantifying the stiffness of a polymer). The lattermost parameter was introduced for the chatkteristic of bending stiffness of amyloids similarly to that in a model of wormlike chain for polymers. The manual measurements of these parameters take a lot of time and, due to the human factor, are insufficiently representative. ImageJ/FiJi is open-source software and one of the most commonly used program for image processing. The ImageJ/FiJi community provides BoneJ plugin for bones analysis and Diameter! plugin for nanofibers analysis, which have the function of determining the diameter of the respective objects. Also, approaches that involve calculations of the end-to-end distances and contour lengths of biopolymers were used to determine their persistence lengths using ImageJ/FiJi. These above mentioned plugins are not designed for the study of amyloids and have never been used or validated for them. They do not provide the necessary functionality for the automatic recognition of amyloids on the substrate and filtering objects by a number of parameters.

"Although the construction industry has shown significant improvements in safety performance over the past 30years, falls are still a leading cause of fatalities and serious injuries. Previous studies have focused on identifying factors affecting the risk of falls, but remained silent on investigating the evidential relationships among these factors to better prevent fall accidents. This research proposes a Bayesian network (BN) based approach to diagnose the accident risk of working at heights. The proposed approach consists of a conceptual and generic model with a protocol for assessing the risk of falls and a computational module. The generic BN model was developed on the basis of an extensive review and evaluation of causal factors leading to falls. The computational module was developed on the basis of Bayes' rule for inference to customize model input and job site characteristics. The results of the proposed approach provide probabilities associated with different states of safety risk. Additionally, sensitivity analysis allows practitioners to identify appropriate preventive actions and safety strategies to reduce risk of fall. The proposed approach was verified and tested with a construction operation in a condo-hotel project. This study contributes to the construction safety body of knowledge by providing an effective quantitative risk assessment tool to predict the safety risk of falls from heights.

"A new research field in translational neuroscience has opened as a result of the recognition since 2002 that ""spreading depression of Le (a) over tilde $o'' can be detected in many patients with acute brain injury, whether vascular and spontaneous, or traumatic in origin, as well as in those many individuals experiencing the visual (or sensorimotor) aura of migraine. In this review, we trace from their first description in rabbits through to their detection and study in migraine and the injured human brain, and from our personal perspectives, the evolution of understanding of the importance of spread of mass depolarisations in cerebral grey matter. Detection of spontaneous depolarisations occurring and spreading in the periphery or penumbra of experimental focal cortical ischemic lesions and of their adverse effects on the cerebral cortical microcirculation and on the tissue glucose and oxygen pools has led to clearer concepts of how ischaemic and traumatic lesions evolve in the injured human brain, and of how to seek to improve clinical management and outcome. Recognition of the likely fundamental significance of spreading depolarisations for this wide range of serious acute encephalopathies in humans provides a powerful case for a fresh examination of neuroprotection strategies.

"Acute mechanical damage and the resulting joint contact abnormalities are central to the initiation and progression of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Study of PTOA is typically performed in vivo with replicate animals using artificially induced injury features. The goal of this work was to measure changes in a joint contact stress in the knee of a large quadruped after creation of a clinically realistic overload injury and a focal cartilage defect. Whole-joint overload was achieved by excising a 5-mm wedge of the anterior medial meniscus. Focal cartilage defects were created using a custom pneumatic impact gun specifically developed and mechanically characterized for this work. To evaluate the effect of these injuries on joint contact mechanics, Tekscan (Tekscan, Inc., South Boston, MA) measurements were obtained pre-operatively, postmeniscectomy, and postimpact (1.2-J) in a nonrandomized group of axially loaded cadaveric sheep knees. Postmeniscectomy, peak contact stress in the medial compartment is increased by 71% (p = 0.03) and contact area is decreased by 35% (p = 0.001); the center of pressure (CoP) shifted toward the cruciate ligaments in both the medial (p = 0.004) and lateral (p = 0.03) compartments. The creation of a cartilage defect did not significantly change any aspect of contact mechanics measured in the meniscectomized knee. This work characterizes the mechanical environment present in a quadrupedal animal knee joint after two methods to reproducibly induce joint injury features that lead to PTOA.

"A hybrid electric-thermal (HET) following method is proposed for a combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system driven by natural gas and solar energy, focusing on the supply matching of domestic hot water, space cooling/heating and electricity. The domestic hot water thermal demand (Class A) is set to be met preferentially due to its immediateness and timeliness, and the space cooling/heating (Class B) thermal demand matching condition will be discussed from the view of comfort reliability. Detailed strategy methods under summer and winter conditions are presented. Variable electric-thermal ratio (RA, the ratio of the thermal demand of domestic hot water to the electric demand, RE, the ratio of the thermal demand of space cooling/heating to the electric demand) load conditions are analyzed and a comparison of HET between the base following electric load and following thermal load strategies is discussed for hotel applications. The criteria including primary energy consumption, carbon dioxide emission, operation cost and exergy efficiency is employed to evaluate the performances in the HET strategy.

This paper specifies the working principle of the isolator, analyses magnetic induction distribution of three different types of MRE isolators, which are unicoil magnetic energy input, twin coil magnetic energy input, and laminated steel plate coiling magnetic energy input respectively. The research shows that the third type of input produces relatively greater magnetic induction in the elastomer area, compared with the first two, and the magnetic field is evenly distributed in MRE area, therefore, it is the best structure. Eventually, the mechanical model of MRE isolator made of two steel slices and one elastomer slice is established together with the mechanical model made of multi-steel slices and multi-elastomer laminated structure. Furthermore, the numerical analysis is completed and the results show that MRE isolators have content adjustable behaviour.

Steroids were extracted by liquid/ liquid extraction, and derivatized with N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-trifluoracetamide. Electron ionization at 30 eV was applied to generate high abundant precursor ions. Specific precursor/product transitions were generated a priori for each compound of interest and these assays were then used to selectively detect and quantify these steroids. Using the selected reaction monitoring mode, detection limits in the pg/ml (sub nmol/l) range could be achieved for all four steroid compounds.

"Advances in computing technology and computer graphics engulfed with huge collections of data have introduced new visualization techniques. This gives users many choices of visualization techniques to gain an insight about the dataset at hand. However, selecting the most suitable visualization for a given dataset and the task to be performed on the data is subjective. The work presented here introduces a set of visualization metrics to quantify visualization techniques. Based on a comprehensive literature survey, we propose effectiveness, expressiveness, readability, and interactivity as the visualization metrics. Using these metrics, a framework for optimizing the layout of a visualization technique is also presented. The framework is based on an evolutionary algorithm (EA) which uses treemaps as a case study. The EA starts with a randomly initialized population, where each chromosome of the population represents one complete treemap. Using the genetic operators and the proposed visualization metrics as an objective function, the EA finds the optimum visualization layout. The visualizations that evolved are compared with the state-of-the-art treemap visualization tool through a user study. The user study utilizes benchmark tasks for the evaluation. A comparison is also performed using direct assessment, where internal and external visualization metrics are used. Results are further verified using analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. The results suggest better performance of the proposed metrics and the EA-based framework for optimizing visualization layout. The proposed methodology can also be extended to other visualization techniques. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"Among the emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM) technologies, some resistive memories, including phase change memory (PCM), spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-RAM), and metal-oxide resistive RAM (ReRAM), have been considered as promising replacements of conventional dynamic RAM (DRAM) to build future main memory systems. Main memory databases can benefit from their nice features, such as their low leakage power and nonvolatility, the high density of PCM, the good read performance and low read energy consumption of STT-RAM, and the low cost of ReRAM's crossbar architecture. However, they also have some disadvantages, such as their long write latency, high write energy, and limited lifetime, which bring challenges to database algorithm design for NVM-based memory systems. In this paper, we focus on the design of the ubiquitous B+-tree, aiming to make it NVM-friendly. We present a basic cost model for NVM-based memory systems which distinguishes writes from reads, and propose detailed CPU cost and memory access models for search, insert, and delete operations on a B+-tree. Based on the proposed models, we analyze the CPU costs and memory behaviors of the existing NVM-friendly B+-tree schemes, and find that they suffer from three issues. To address these issues we propose three different schemes. Experimental results show that our schemes can efficiently improve the performance, reduce the memory energy consumption, and extend the lifetime for NVM-based memory systems.

"Agriculture has been recognized as a major anthropogenic source of surplus loads of nitrogen in the environment. Losses of nitrate via subsurface pathways are severely threatening groundwater and surface waters. This study explored the capability of a coupled hydro-biogeochemical spatially explicit model, simulating nitrogen cycling in agricultural soils and the associated fate of excess nitrate subjected to vertical and lateral displacement towards water bodies. Different vegetated buffer strips (VBS) were tested for their nitrate retention capability and impacts on N2O and N-2 emissions. The effectiveness of a VBS to remove nitrate by denitrification strongly depends on soil characteristics and hydrological flow paths. Simulated N2 emissions from VBS with high soil moisture were up to twenty-fold compared to VBS where groundwater levels were low. Simulated sneamwater nitrate concentrations without VBS were 3.7 mg NO3(-) 1(-1) and showed a decrease to 0.1 mg NO3- 1(-1) for a 20 m VBS. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"A generalized partial-element equivalent-circuit (PEEC) method is proposed for modeling a planar circuit with a thin narrow slot on the ground. The approach is based on the coupled mixed potential integral equations for a problem with mixed electric and magnetic currents. The coupled integral equations are converted into a lumped-element circuit network using Kirchhoff's voltage law and Kirchhoff's current law of the circuit theory. The full-wave Green's functions for a grounded dielectric substrate problem are used. The interactions between electric current on a microstrip line and magnetic current on a slot are taken into account by introducing two kinds of controlled sources. This generalized PEEC model will be very useful in signal-integrity analysis for multilayered circuits. To validate the generalized model, three numerical examples consisting of microstrip lines and slots on the ground are presented. The results obtained by the proposed generalized PEEC model are compared with those obtained by commercial electromagnetic simulation software and published experimental results.

"A working theoretical model for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) does not exist, hampered by the lack of any clear cut invention that address all symptom and signs of the disease. Reports of cessation of symptom and signs of both major types of IBS have been published using a non-systemic, topically active agent-high potency polymerized cross-linked sucralfate (HPPCLS). The unique clinical effect of this non-systemic agent restricted to the luminal surface of the gut provides opportunity to elaborate on an alternative working model for the pathogenesis of IBS and FGIDs. While the chemical determinants of HPPCLS and the mucosal lining contribute to the clinical effects, the sequence of events resides in the functional interplay among elements within the mucosa itself. The proposed model assumes that failure of a pre-existing genomic-controlled surveillance of the epithelium localized to the luminal surface triggers primary and secondary immune activation of inflammation intent on restoring epithelial homeostasis. Delayed restoration of homeostasis results in all the symptoms, signs and likely molecular events that characterize IBS and FGIDs.

These factors include the patient's socio-economic background, age, gender, presenting symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory findings and, in particular, non-adherence versus adherence to therapy. Methods Data were collected from all adult patients admitted to Kalafong Hospital with laboratory confirmed cryptococcal meningitis over a period of 24 months. We analyzed the data by the presentation of descriptive summary statistics, logistic regression was used to assess factors which showed association between outcome of measure and factor. Furthermore, multivariable logistic regression analysis using all the factors that showed significant association in the cross tabulation was applied to determine which factors had an impact on the patients' mortality risk. Results A total of 87 patients were identified. All except one were HIV-positive, of which 55.2% were antiretroviral therapy naive. A history of previous tuberculosis was given by 25 patients (28.7%) and 49 (56.3%) were on tuberculosis treatment at admission or started during their hospital stay. In-hospital mortality was 31%. Statistical analysis showed that antiretroviral therapy naive patients had 9.9 (CI 95% 1.2-81.2, p<0.0032) times greater odds of dying compared to those on antiretroviral therapy, with 17 from 48 patients (35.4%) dying compared with 1 out of 21 patients (4.8%) on treatment. Defaulters had 14.7 (CI 95% 1.6-131.6, p<0.016) times greater odds of dying, with 9 from 18 patients dying (50%), compared to the non-defaulters. In addition, patients who presented with nausea and vomiting had a 6.3 (95% CI 1.7-23.1, p<0.005) times greater odds of dying (18/47, 38.3%); this remained significant when adjusted for antiretroviral therapy naive patients and defaulters. Conclusion Cryptococcal meningitis is still a common opportunistic infection in people living with HIV/AIDS resulting in hospitalization and a high mortality.

"Ablation strategies targeting areas of complex fractionated atrial electrograms are not successful for treatment of atrial fibrillation. Fractionation of atrial electrograms may have multiple causes of both pathologic and nonpathologic origin. In order to gain insight into the definitions used for determining areas of fractionation, a literature search was performed using a systematic approach. A PubMed search for studies describing fractionation during human atrial electrophysiologic measurements resulted in 348 articles that were screened for new definitions of fractionation. The 24studies remaining after screening described 11 different visual definitions for fractionation, 3 automated complex fractionated atrial electrogram detection programs, and 7 new parameters for measuring fractionation. Five different definitions for continuous electrical activity were presented. Electrode properties were often not described, and endocardial bipolar recordings in recent studies used electrode diameters ranging from 1 to 8 mm with interelectrode distance of 2-5 mm. In summary, no uniform definition or recording method is used for measuring fractionation of cardiac atrial electrograms. The different electrophysiologic causes of fractionation and the influence of recording device properties on fractionation complicate identification of true pathologic inhomogeneous conduction. The first step in discrimination between origins of fractionation may be accomplished by relating electrogram morphology to spatial patterns of activation. Before revisiting ablation of areas with fractionated electrograms, we need to determine the correct method for identifying pathologic fractionation.

"Among uncertain graph queries, reachability, i.e., the probability that one vertex is reachable from another, is likely the most fundamental one. Although this problem has been studied within the field of network reliability, solutions are implemented on a single computer and can only handle small graphs. However, as the size of graph applications continually increases, the corresponding graph data can no longer fit within a single computer's memory and must therefore be distributed across several machines. Furthermore, the computation of probabilistic reachability queries is #P-complete making it very expensive even on small graphs. In this paper, we develop an efficient distributed strategy, called DistR, to solve the problem of reachability query over large uncertain graphs. Specifically, we perform the task in two steps: distributed graph reduction and distributed consolidation. In the distributed graph reduction step, we find all of the maximal subgraphs of the original graph, whose reachability probabilities can be calculated in polynomial time, compute them and reduce the graph accordingly. After this step, only a small graph remains. In the distributed consolidation step, we transform the problem into a relational join process and provide an approximate answer to the #P-complete reachability query. Extensive experimental studies show that our distributed approach is efficient in terms of both computational and communication costs, and has high accuracy.

"According to many published literature, parallel computing is regarded as an efficient solution in digital terrain analysis (DTA) of geographic information system. The stable and credible services play an irreplaceable role in the high performance computing, especially when an error occurs in large-scale science computing. In this paper, a new approach for the parallel DTA considering the performance of fault-tolerance was proposed: fast parallel re-computation (FPR). FPR owns a fast self-recovery ability based on redundancy mechanisms compared to other fault-tolerant methods. Once some errors in application layers are detected, the data block having computation errors is further partitioned into several sub-blocks, which are re-computed by the surviving processes concurrently to improve the efficiency of failure recovery. The overlapping strategy of error detection and re-computation is presented through decomposing the data block into several logic sub-blocks. As a result, when an error of a logical sub-block of the data block is detected by a comparing thread the re-computing process immediately starts to correct the error. This strategy reduces the time of re-computation and error detection by overlapping them comparing the traditional re-computation method. The experiments show that the proposed FPR method can achieve better performance efficiency with fewer overhead.

"A novel system decoupling approach (SDA) that enables three degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) bridge flutter analysis is proposed in this study to simultaneously investigate the relationships between modal parameters and 18 flutter derivatives. Based on the incentive-feedback mechanisms, the aerodynamic coupled system is conveniently decoupled in an iterative solution. Based on the SDA, it is unnecessary to simultaneously calculate all multiple frequencies for determining modal parameters and eventually quantifying critical flutter wind velocity. The efficacy and accuracy of the SDA is verified using a numerical example of thin flat plate. The coupling effects among three DOFs and influence of 18 flutter derivatives on flutter performance are quantified using the newly proposed method. The flutter mechanisms of thin flat plate and bluff deck section of the Akashi Kaikyo Suspension Bridge are numerically examined, and both difference and common grounds for two typical flutter phenomena are summarized. The results by the SDA show good agreement with those by the commonly used complex eigen-value analysis (CEVA). For the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge with bluff deck section, the analytical results of 2-DOF coupled flutter are coincident with the 3-DOF case and the experimental observations. This study provides significant insights into the flutter characteristics of 3-DOF bridges and explores the roles played by various parameters in modifying bridge deck aerodynamics and the evolution of modal coupling with increasing wind velocity. The simplified formulation that only concerns is presented, by which acceptable accuracy of flutter parameters can also be achieved for torsional modal branch. It is validated using a thin flat plate and the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge with bluff deck.

"Age-related changes in brain structure are a question of interest to a broad field of research. Structural decline has been consistently, but not unambiguously, linked to functional consequences, including cognitive impairment and dementia. One of the areas considered of crucial importance throughout this process is the medial temporal lobe, and primarily the hippocampal region. Gender also has a considerable effect on volume deterioration of subcortical grey matter ( GM) structures, such as the hippocampus. The influence of agexgender interaction on disproportionate GM volume changes might be mediated by hormonal effects on the brain. Hippocampal volume loss appears to become accelerated in the postmenopausal period. This decline might have significant influences on neuroplasticity in the CA1 region of the hippocampus highly vulnerable to pathological influences. Additionally, menopause has been associated with critical pathobiochemical changes involved in neurodegeneration. The micro-and macrostructural alterations and consequent functional deterioration of critical hippocampal regions might result in clinical cognitive impairment-especially if there already is a decline in the cognitive reserve capacity. Several lines of potential vulnerability factors appear to interact in the menopausal period eventually leading to cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, or Alzheimer's disease. This focused review aims to delineate the influence of unmodifiable risk factors of neurodegenerative processes, i.e., age and gender, on critical subcortical GM structures in the light of brain derived estrogen effects. The menopausal period appears to be of key importance for the risk of cognitive decline representing a time of special vulnerability for molecular, structural, and functional influences and offering only a narrow window for potential protective effects.

The CREKA peptide was fused to IFN gamma's C-terminus, with or without a matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2)-cleavable linker (IFN gamma-mmp-CREKA or IFN gamma-CREKA, respectively). The former was designed to release IFN gamma from IFN gamma-mmp-CREKA bound to fibrin clots, to ensure IFN gamma's function in the tumor milieu. IFN gamma-activated sequence-dependent reporter gene expression in B16-BL6 cells revealed that the biological activities of IFNg-CREKA and IFN gamma were comparable, whereas that of IFN gamma-mmp-CREKA was approximately 60% that of IFNg. Plasma concentrations of IFN gamma-CREKA and IFN gamma-mmp-CREKA remained at effective levels for at least 4 weeks after gene transfer into mice. After gene transfer to tumor-bearing mice, intratumoral concentration of IFN gamma in pCpG-IFN gamma-mmp-CREKA group was tended to be higher than those of the other groups. Inhibition of colon-26 tumor growth was significantly more with gene transfer of IFN gamma-mmp-CREKA than with IFNg or IFN gamma-CREKA. These results indicate that targeted delivery of IFN gamma to fibrin clots through IFN gamma-mmp-CREKA fusion can enhance the therapeutic efficacy of IFN gamma in cancer gene therapy.

"A probabilistic relational database is a probability distribution over a set of deterministic relational databases (namely, possible worlds). Efficient updating information in probabilistic databases is required in several applications, such as sensor networking and data cleaning. As a way to update a probabilistic database, conditioning refines the probability distribution of the possible worlds based on general knowledge, such as functional dependencies. The existing methods for conditioning are exponential over the number of variables in the probabilistic database for an arbitrary constraint. In this paper, a constraint-based conditioning framework is proposed, which solves the conditioning problem by considering only the variables in the given constraint. Then, we prove the correctness of our proposed approach and provide efficient algorithms for each step of the approach. Afterward, a pruning strategy that can significantly improve the efficiency of the constraint-based approach is proposed for the functional dependency constraints. Furthermore, for functional dependency constraints, a variable-elimination strategy that minimizes the number of generated variables can benefit the subsequent query processing. The experimental study shows that the constraint based approach is more efficient than other approaches described in the literature. The effectiveness of the two optimization strategies for functional dependency constraints is also demonstrated in the experiment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Ambient Intelligence is the vision of future in which environments support the people living in them. This environment is self-effacing, interconnected, adaptable, dynamic, embedded, and intelligent. The vision is to disappear the technology instead processors and sensors are integrated in everyday objects. To develop such an environment wherein technology is invisible to the user and environment directly communicates with the user. A completely interactive environment that could assists the users in every possible manner. In order to design and develop such an environment, there is a need to shift technology from machine to human communication to machine to machine communication (M2M). For such communication there is the requirement of real time data, energy and the decision making concepts which are considered as the main objectives that needs to be fulfilled. In this paper we present the major contribution of various researchers in this field. Further we have also discussed the major challenges and risks associated with such intelligent environment and a methodology to overcome with the challenges in AmI environment.

"A study was made of the characteristics of older adults showing an interest in participating in a health education course given by peers. Determining the degree of interest in health education is important for assessing the impact on the target-population and evaluating the dissemination strategy. In the course 'Successful Aging' groups of alder adults came together to discuss health related issues. The course was given by senior health educators aged 55 years and over from the peer group. To determine interest in the course answer cards were sent with a letter of invitation to all independently living inhabitants aged between 55 an 79 in a Dutch community. The rate of expressed interest in the course was 5.8%. Interest was highest among females in the 55-64 age group, the unmarried and those with low wellbeing. Males in the age group 65-79, females aged 75-79, those with a lower socio-economic status and the inactive were comparatively less interested. Subscription to the course was distinguished from mere interest in the course. From those who expressed interest, more people of low socio-economic status, with a reduced level of wellbeing, many physical limitations and poor self-efficacy actually subscribed. It is concluded that the health education program will be continued and that special attention will be paid to groups that showed lower levels of uptake. Involving intermediates from these groups in the course development is recommended. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

"AIM To identify a set of contributors, and weight and rank them on a pathophysiological basis. METHODS Patients who have undergone a lactulose or glucose hydrogen breath test to rule out small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) for various clinical symptoms, including diarrhoea, weight loss, abdominal pain, cramping or bloating, were seen as eligible for inclusion in a retrospective single-centre study. Clinical data such as co-morbidities, medication, laboratory parameters and other possible risk factors have been identified from the electronic data system. Cases lacking or with substantially incomplete clinical data were excluded from the analysis. Suspected contributors were summarised under four different pathophysiological pathways (impaired gastric acid barrier, impaired intestinal clearance, immunosuppression and miscellaneous factors including thyroid gland variables) and investigated using the chi(2) test, Student's t-test and logistic regression models. RESULTS A total of 1809 patients who had undergone hydrogen breath testing were analysed. Impairment of the gastric acid barrier (gastrectomy, odds ratio: OR = 3.5, PPI therapy OR = 1.4), impairment of intestinal clearance (any resecting gastric surgery OR = 2.6, any colonic resection OR = 1.9, stenosis OR = 3.4, gastroparesis OR = 3.4, neuropathy 2.2), immunological factors (any drug-induced immunosuppression OR = 1.8), altered thyroid gland metabolism (hypothyroidism OR = 2.6, levothyroxine therapy OR = 3.0) and diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.9) were associated significantly to SIBO. Any abdominal surgery, ileocecal resection, vagotomy or IgA-deficiency did not have any influence, and a history of appendectomy decreased the risk of SIBO. Multivariate analysis revealed gastric surgery, stenoses, medical immunosuppression and levothyroxine to be the strongest predictors. Levothyroxine therapy was the strongest contributor in a simplified model (OR = 3.0). CONCLUSION The most important contributors for the development of SIBO in ascending order are immunosuppression, impairment of intestinal clearance and levothyroxine use, but they do not sufficiently explain its emergence.

"A simple voltage-to-frequency converter (VFC) with modulated duty cycles is proposed. The proposed VFC is composed of an operational amplifier, a voltage-to-current circuit, a charge and discharge circuit, a comparator, and a Schmitt trigger. The 50% duty cycle signal is always obtained at the output of the Schmitt trigger and multiple duty cycles can be obtained at the output of the comparator by simply adjusting an external voltage level. Due to its simplicity, the proposed VFC circuit can be easily combined with other circuitry to extend its practical application. The errors caused by the circuit non-idealities are investigated to quantify the trade-offs between performance and cost. The proposed VFC, which features modulated duty cycles, is realized in a standard 0.18-m 1P6M complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, and an active area of 210mx190m is occupied. Experimental results show that the proposed converter is useful for output frequency ranges from 315kHz to 2.53MHz with an input voltage range of 0.2-1.6V and a power consumption of 0.8mW.

Basically, it identifies inverse error dynamics using a radial basis neural network with daughter RASP1 wavelets activation function; its output is in cascaded with an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter to prune irrelevant signals and nodes as well as to recover a canonical form. Then, online adaptive fuzzy tuning of a discrete PID regulator is proposed, whose closed-loop guarantees global regulation for nonlinear dynamical plants. The wavelet network includes a fuzzy inference system for online tuning of learning rates.

"A prior epidemiological study identified a reduction in opioid overdose deaths in US states that legalized medical cannabis (MC). One theory to explain this phenomenon is a potential substitution effect of MC for opioids. This study evaluated whether this substitution effect of MC for opioids also applies to other psychoactive medications. New England dispensary members (n = 1,513) completed an online survey about their medical history and MC experiences. Among respondents that regularly used opioids, over three-quarters (76.7%) indicated that they reduced their use since they started MC. This was significantly (p < 0.0001) greater than the patients that reduced their use of antidepressants (37.6%) or alcohol (42.0%). Approximately two-thirds of patients decreased their use of anti-anxiety (71.8%), migraine (66.7%), and sleep (65.2%) medications following MC which significantly (p < 0.0001) exceeded the reduction in antidepressants or alcohol use. The patient's spouse, family, and other friends were more likely to know about their MC use than was their primary care provider. In conclusion, a majority of patients reported using less opioids as well as fewer medications to treat anxiety, migraines, and sleep after initiating MC. A smaller portion used less antidepressants or alcohol. Additional research is needed to corroborate these self-reported, retrospective, cross-sectional findings using other data sources.

"A fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based digital calibration method for 1.5 bit/stage pipeline analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is proposed in this paper. Capacitor mismatch and finite gain of the operational amplifier (OPAMP) can be overcome by the proposed calibration method. Given that the capacitor mismatch and the finite OPAMP gain cause the radix of all the stages of 1.5 bit/stage pipeline ADC to become unequal to 2, the FFT processor can be adopted to evaluate the actual radixes of all the stages and then generate new digital output to compensate for error caused by these non-ideal effects. Moreover, as capacitor mismatch and the finite gain of OPAMP can be compensated, low-gain OPAMP can be used in high-performance ADC to reduce power dissipation; a small capacitor can then be adopted to save on space. An example of a 10 bit 1.5 bit/stage pipelined ADC with only an 8 bit circuit performance is implemented in 0.18 mu m TSMC CMOS process. Circuit measurement result reveals that the signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio of 51.03 dB with 11 dB improvement after calibration can be achieved at the sample rate of 1 MHz.

"A low cost, fast and reliable microcontroller based protection scheme using wavelet transform and artificial neural network has been proposed and its effectiveness evaluated in real time. The proposed scheme, based on the hardware co-simulation approach performs all the functions of transmission line protection i.e. fault detection/classification, fault zone/section identification and location estimation. The fault detection/classification and zone identification algorithms use fundamental frequency current component to estimate a fault index. The fault location estimation module uses wavelet transform coefficients in hybridization with a parallel artificial neural network structure. For hardware implementation, a 8-bit ATmega microcontroller is used and interfaced with the simulated power system model using Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The scheme is tested on a power system model of 400 kV, 50 Hz three phase double circuit line with source at both the ends. Laboratory tests have been performed in real time for 20,000 fault cases including evolving faults with varying fault resistance, fault inception angle, fault distance, direction of power flow angle and its magnitude. The tests confirm the suitability and reliability of proposed scheme even with Current Transformer (CT) saturation. The implementation of the proposed approach on a low cost microcontroller with the lesser execution time, makes the prototype ideal for implementation on a digital platform (digital relay), thus leading to financial viability and sustainability of the protection scheme.

"An intensification of agriculture in the Brazilian Cerrado during the last four decades has resulted in unintended consequences such as increased groundwater and surface water pollution due to excessive N fertilization. To address these problems within a coffee (Coffea arabica L.) orchard, the process-based ANIMO model was used to simulate nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) leaching and plant nitrogen (N) uptake for several rates of N (200-800 kg h(-1) y(-1)). Effects of splitting N applications from three times per year to every other day were also evaluated for a Typic Hapludox within the Cerrado. Statistical analysis of ANIMO outputs showed that simulated soil solution NO3-N concentrations were in agreement with experimental measurements collected for an entire year. Simulated annual N uptake was also in agreement with average measured N uptake by the coffee plants. An evaluation of the simulation scenarios showed that: i) the most efficient N recovery was associated with N rates between 200 and 400 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) that were split into at least seven applications per year; ii) N recovery at rates between 200 and 300 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) were efficient with or without split application; and iii) the most environmentally friendly N management strategy was the application of between 200 and 300 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) using at least seven splits. Reducing the N rate from 600 to 400 kg N ha (-1) y(-1) increased plant N recovery efficiency by 8-12% and reduced NO3-N leaching by 28 to 47%. Predicted NO3-N leaching and N plant uptake results confirm that better N management strategies can be developed for coffee plantations and other crops grown in the Cerrado. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"1. INTRODUCTION Sustainability has been defined as the need to preserve existing natural resources so that the earth is able to continue to provide these resources for future generations. Put more simply, a sustainable system is one that survives or persists (Costanza and Patten, 1995). In order to ensure the sustainability of architectural and building activity, it is essential that work in this field is conducted in accordance with the canons of basic ecology and, in addition, that its members seek to address certain cultural and relational characteristics that typify the way we live today. Architecture as a discipline combines technology and art; however, with the advent of ""sustainable architecture"" additional concepts from the fields of ecology, sociology, and philosophy have been incorporated. Yet, the fundamental problem is that the meanings of both the classical and the new concepts remain ambiguous, their significance shifting with our cultural evolution. Hence, the traditional Vitruvian values of architecture (beauty, structure and utility) are no longer so obvious, especially when we are required to think in terms of sustainability. Although the question as to why architecture matters has been answered in a variety of ways (Glaeser, 2011), it is our contention that in the 21st century architecture will matter more than ever, because by 2050 most of the world's population will be concentrated in cities. As a result, the sustainability of dwellings and cities has acquired undeniable importance. Two interacting forces influence all populations. One is the Malthusian dynamic of exponential growth until environmental limits are reached (Figure 1). The second is the Darwinian dynamics of innovation and adaptation that circumvent these limits through biological or cultural evolution. Nekola et al., in 2013 reported that the specific manifestation of these two forces in our current society provide the context that establishes how humans may develop sustainable relationships within our finite planet (Figure 2). Consequently, a permanent and indefinite growth is impossible due to the physical and biological imperatives of our finite world. Biologists and architects and constructors usually inhabit different worlds. The latter innovate, deploy, and apply their techno-science based designs; the first, study the finite nature, propose hypotheses, and gather their evidence. And, to date, there is little to suggest that copying nature purports any advantages to architects, primarily because fully autonomous buildings or towns have yet to be built. According to the described Malthusian-Darwinian dynamic, the two critical questions that we seek to address in this paper are: i) What is the essence of a sustainable dwelling? and ii) What principles should be adhered to in making a dwelling sustainable? In other words, this study aims to elucidate the essence of sustainability in green building design implementation.

"A general synthesis procedure is given for a versatile signal flow graph realization of a general current transfer function by using multi-output second generation current controlled current conveyors (MO-CCCIIs). The proposed configuration uses n + 1 multi-output second generation cur-rent conveyors (MO-CCIIs), n capacitors and at most 2(n + 1) resistors. This number of resistors can be reduced to n for special cases. Using MO-CCCIIs instead of MO-CCIIs, the resistors can be removed completely for the nth-order universal structure. The general transfer function having any numerator dynamics can be derived from the universal structure by using a single MO-CCCII and at most n + I resistors. It is very easy to find the values of the passive elements from the coefficients of the transfer function to be realized.

"Abnormalities in thyroid function are common endocrine disorders that affect 5-10% of the general population, with hypothyroidism occurring more frequently than hyperthyroidism. Clinical symptoms and signs are often nonspecific, particularly in hypothyroidism. Muscular symptoms (stiffness, myalgias, cramps, easy fatigability) are mentioned by the majority of patients with frank hypothyroidism. Often underestimated is the fact that muscle symptoms may represent the predominant or the only clinical manifestation of hypothyroidism, raising the issue of a differential diagnosis with other causes of myopathy, which sometimes can be difficult. Elevated serum creatine kinase, which not necessarily correlates with the severity of the myopathic symptoms, is certainly suggestive of muscle impairment, though it does not explain the cause. Rare muscular manifestations, associated with hypothyroidism, are rhabdomyolysis, acute compartment syndrome, Hoffman's syndrome and Kocher-Debre-Semelaigne syndrome. Though the pathogenesis of hypothyroid myopathy is not entirely known, proposed mechanisms include altered glycogenolytic and oxidative metabolism, altered expression of contractile proteins, and neuro-mediated damage. Correlation studies of haplotype, muscle gene expression and protein characterization, could help understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of this myopathic presentation of hypothyroidism.

"A simplified method for measuring the fluidic resistance (R-fluidic) of microfluidic channels is presented, in which the electrical resistance (R-elec) of a channel filled with a conductivity standard solution can be measured and directly correlated to R-fluidic using a simple equation. Although a slight correction factor could be applied in this system to improve accuracy, results showed that a standard voltage meter could be used without calibration to determine R-fluidic to within 12% error. Results accurate to within 2% were obtained when a geometric correction factor was applied using these particular channels. When compared to standard flow rate measurements, such as meniscus tracking in outlet tubing, this approach provided a more straightforward alternative and resulted in lower measurement error. The method was validated using 9 different fluidic resistance values (from similar to 40 to 600 kPa s mm(-3)) and over 30 separately fabricated microfluidic devices. Furthermore, since the method is analogous to resistance measurements with a voltage meter in electrical circuits, dynamic R-fluidic measurements were possible in more complex microfluidic designs. Microchannel R-elec was shown to dynamically mimic pressure waveforms applied to a membrane in a variable microfluidic resistor. The variable resistor was then used to dynamically control aqueous-in-oil droplet sizes and spacing, providing a unique and convenient control system for droplet-generating devices. This conductivity-based method for fluidic resistance measurement is thus a useful tool for static or real-time characterization of microfluidic systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"A power distribution grid exhibits the characteristics of a weak grid owing to the existence of scattered high-power distributed power-generation devices. The grid impedance affects the robust stability of grid-connected inverters, leading to harmonic resonance, or even instability in the system.

The output impedance modeling of an LCL-type single-phase grid-connected inverter is derived, where the effects of the PLL loop and the digital control delays on the output impedance characteristics have been taken into account. To enhance the stability of grid-connected inverters with different grid impedance, a novel impedance-phased compensation control strategy is proposed by increasing the phase margin of the grid-connected inverters. Specifically, a detailed implementation and parameter design of the impedance-phased compensation control method is depicted.

The storage unit is made of inert honeycomb supports (cordierite) coated with 88 kg of redox active material (cobalt oxide). An experimental campaign has been carried out consisting of 22 thermochemical charge-discharge cycles.

During the complete campaign no measurable cycle-to-cycle degradation was observed and the system average capacity was very close to the ideal case of P-F = 0.84. The advantage of thermochemical storage could be quantified by comparing the storage capacity, to that of a sensible-only storage unit made of uncoated cordierite honeycombs.

"Adult T cell Leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a mature T-cell neoplasm that has strong association with the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-I) infection. This infection is endemic in our region (north eastern Iran). It has been highlighted that Janus Kinase family proteins and specially JAK2 mutations have a pivotal role in the development of many types of hematological malignancies and in particular myeloproliferative neoplasms. So far, the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to the ATL are not well understood. Therefore, in this study it was hypothesized that JAK2 (V617F) mutation may be present in samples from patients with ATL. This case control study was performed in north-eastern Iran. Using polymerase chain reaction, JAK2 (V617F) mutation was performed in 20 DNA samples from ATL patients and 20 HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers (control group).

In the case group 13 (65 %) and 7 patients (35 %) were male and female respectively, with the age range between 40 and 80 years. Only one patients has JAK2 mutation and this mutation was absent in 95 % of ATL patients as well as the HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers. The results of our study demonstrated that JAK2 V617F mutation is not a common phenomenon in ATL.

"A new fault diagnosis method based on multi-signal flow graph (MSFG) has been proposed to deal with online complex system diagnosis. This method has three steps. The first step is to develop a multi-signal graph model for the object system and generate a dependency matrix as diagnostic knowledge. The second step is to generate conflict sets by the dependency matrix and the system observation vector, and then the problem of finding the minimal diagnosis set is transformed into a problem of integer programming. In the final step, the optimal solution of the problem of integer programming is calculated by using a branch-and-bound algorithm for diagnosis. In this way, explosion problem caused by enumeration can be avoided.

"After coming to rest on the night side of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the ROLIS camera on-board Rosetta's Philae lander acquired five images of the surface below the lander, four of which were with the aid of LED illumination of different colors. The images confirm that Philae was perched on a sloped surface. A local horizon is visible in one corner of the image, beyond which we can see the coma. Having spent a full day on the surface Philae was commanded to lift and rotate, after which a final, sixth, LED image was acquired. The change in perspective allowed us to construct a shape model of the surface. The distance to the foreground was about 80 cm, much larger than the nominal 30 cm. This caused stray light, rather than directly reflected LED light, to dominate the image signal, complicating the analysis. The images show a lumpy surface with a roughness of apparently fractal nature. Its appearance is completely different from that of the first landing site, which was characterized by centimeter to meter-sized debris (Mottola et al., 2015). We recognize neither particles nor pores at the image resolution of 0.8 mm per pixel and large color variations are absent. The surface has a bi-modal brightness distribution that can be interpreted in terms of the degree of consolidation, a hypothesis that we support with experimental evidence. We propose the surface below the lander to consist of smooth, cracked plates with unconsolidated edges, similar to terrain seen in CIVA images. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"A new operational amplifier cell for high voltage current sensing applications is presented in this paper. The proposed structure employs a fully low voltage input stage capable of tracking input common modes (CMs) ranging from GND rail to above the supply rail. Furthermore, a solution for ensuring the linearity of the amplifier over the entire operating voltages is discussed. The proposed circuit was implemented in a typical 0.25 mu m CMOS BCD technology and its performances were confirmed by simulations and silicon measurements.

"A recent study reported that the construction management market has grown more competitive. In this environment, identifying a company's competitive position enables a study of competitor strategies and the ability to select the most suitable path to profitability. This study suggests a methodology to analyze topological competiveness based on social relationships between firms modeled according to four subnetworks: Joint contract networks linked directly between firms, public and private networks linked indirectly by owners, and building and civil networks linked indirectly by work type. This study proposes an analytical framework measuring topological competiveness from four perspectives: The network topology among each subnetwork, centralities and structural positions among the firms, cohesive subgroups and strong relations in the subnetwork, and the structural equivalence among firms. Using 2,984 cases of Korean construction management projects from 1997 to 2013, an empirical analysis of topological competiveness validated the methodology to diagnose competitiveness and select the most suitable relationships with competitors to create company growth.

"A composite frequency-selective surface (FSS) fabricated by using an e-beam evaporator is proposed. This manufacturing process is advantageous in that it can directly achieve an FSS function for real structural surfaces with various skin conformations. A multilayered patch-grid-patch-type FSS consisting of copper layers as capacitive or inductive surfaces and a glass/epoxy prepreg as the substrate is produced. It operates at 9-10 GHz for dual polarisation. This technique can be used to manufacture a stealth technology for communicating in a specific frequency range.

"A low-emissive pigment of Al/SiO2/Fe2O3/FeO/Fe-4[Fe(CN)(6)](3)/Cr2O3/Cr (MAS) was prepared by chemical deposition method. The camouflage characteristics of the coated fabric with paint mixed with MAS, binder and other auxiliary in the thermal infrared (IR 8 similar to 14 mu m) and the optical (0.38 similar to 1.2 mu m) region, was studied by emissivity tester, visible light camera and thermal infrared imager. The results show that the MAS pigment has low emissivity and optical camouflage effectiveness compared with the Al/SiO2 pigment. Particularly, the MAS pigment is in green by depositing metal oxide, ferrocyanide and pure metal on the surface of Al/SiO2. The optical reflectance spectrum of coated fabric was similar to the natural grass. Furthermore, the surface emissivity of the coated fabric reached 0.51 in the IR region. The thermography of the coated fabric with 4 wt% MAS was similar to the natural grass. It can conclude that the coated fabric can perfectly imitate grass background.

"A significant proportion of patients with type2 diabetes mellitus have a low testosterone level relative to reference ranges based on healthy young men. Only a small number of these patients suffer from classical hypogonadism as a result of recognizable hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis pathology. The cut-off value of the serum testosterone level in men without obvious hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis pathology is controversial. It is unclear to what extent a low serum testosterone level causally leads to type2 diabetes and/or the metabolic syndrome. From a theoretical standpoint, there can be complex interactions among the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, body composition and insulin resistance, which can be further influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors to give rise to metabolic syndrome, glucose intolerance, and low-grade inflammation to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Although a low serum testosterone level frequently coexists with cardiometabolic risk factors and might serve as a biomarker, more studies are required to clarify the causal, mediating or modifying roles of low serum testosterone level in the development of adverse clinical outcomes. Currently, there are insufficient randomized clinical trial data to evaluate the effects of testosterone replacement therapy on meaningful clinical outcomes. The risk-to-benefit ratio of testosterone therapy in high-risk subjects, such as those with type2 diabetes, also requires elucidation. The present article aims to review the current evidence on low serum testosterone levels in patients with type2 diabetes, and its implications on cardiovascular risk factors, metabolic syndrome and adverse clinical outcomes.

"Accelerated testing (AT) of the Photovoltaic (PV) module is an important procedure to know the effect of weather under outdoor exposure. The module/cell temperature depends on the environmental parameters such as ambient temperature, global irradiation, wind velocity, type of mounting configuration and type of technology. In this paper, the effect of irradiance, temperature and estimate acceleration factor of Glass, EVA and Tedlar of mono-crystalline silicon (sc-Si) PV modules have been studied to trail the Arrhenius behavior in indoor/outdoor operation for a composite climate at the National Institute of Solar Energy, Gurgaon, India. The irradiance and temperature of the Glass/cell/polymer-sheet and Glass/cell/glass have been calculated using equivalent (T-eq) and effective (T-eff) temperature. The maximum Teq and Teff temperature is found to be 49.40 degrees C and 54.95 degrees C for the 50.1 kJ/mol activation energy for Glass/cell/ polymer sheet. Similarly, 51.2 degrees C and 57.2 degrees C are the maximum values of T-eq and T-aff are found in Glass/cell/glass for 50.1 kJ/mol activation energy. In the present study, 50.1 kJ/mol for Glass/cell/polymer sheet configuration required more time to simulate outdoor exposure in comparison to other values of activation energy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"A miniaturized thin film transparent ultrawideband (UWB) antenna design with a band notch is presented. A pair of split-ring resonators (SRRs) is placed besides the radiating element to realize the band notch centered at 5.5 GHz. The proposed transparent antenna covers the whole 3.1 to 10.6 GHz UWB frequency band with a notch from 5 to 6 GHz to isolate interferences from wireless local area network (WLAN) and dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) applications. The transparency of this antenna of up to 80% is enabled by the fabrication on a conductive silver coated thin film (AgHT-8). Hence, the proposed transparent antenna is a suitable for UWB home entertainment network (IEEE 1394 over UWB network) for green building applications, where high data rates are required for multimedia transfer. Implementation of the proposed transparent antenna will reduce the space consumption due to its very low thickness and low profile, while at the same time increasing the aesthetic values of the installed wireless system due to its high transparency.

"A set of novel explicit expressions for the identification of stable, unstable and integrating first-order plus dead time process dynamics is presented. In the absence of sensor noise/static load disturbances, an autonomous relay control system with an asymmetrical relay induces a smooth limit cycle at the process output. Dynamic model parameters are estimated using the set of proposed expressions which depend on the parameters of limit cycle output and its derivatives. However, in practice, the process output is generally corrupted by the measurement noise, thereby rendering an erroneous identification of process dynamics. Furthermore, static load disturbance during an identification test also induces an asymmetrical limit cycle output resulting in inaccurate measurements. Hence, a fast Fourier transform technique and biased relay feedback methods are implemented to obviate the problem of asymmetries and chattering in the limit cycle output yielding the original limit cycle and its subsequent derivatives. The proposed method has been validated, considering five typical examples from literature. An extensive comparison study with existing approaches based on Nyquist plots demonstrate the efficacy of the method presented.

"AIM To investigate the antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects of Cortex Dictamni aqueous extract (CDAE) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver damage in rats. METHODS The in vitro antioxidant effect of CDAE was investigated using alpha, alpha-diphenyl-beta-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), beta-carotene bleaching, reducing power, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assays. A linoleic acid system, including ferric thiocyanate (FTC) and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) assays, was used to evaluate the inhibition of lipid peroxidation. The in vivo hepatoprotective and antioxidant effects of CDAE against CCl4-induced liver damage were evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats. Silymarin was used as a positive control. Liver damage was assessed by determining hepatic histopathology and liver marker enzymes in serum. Enzyme and non-enzyme antioxidant levels and lipid peroxide content were measured in the liver. Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) protein expression was measured via immunohistochemical staining. Nuclear factor E2-related factor (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase catalytic subunit (gamma-GCSc) protein expression was measured by Western blot. RESULTS Our results showed that CDAE exhibited a strong antioxidant activity in vitro. CDAE scavenged DPPH and ABTS radicals in a dose-dependent manner. CDAE inhibited lipid peroxidation with a lipid peroxide inhibition rate of 40.6% +/- 5.2%. In the FTC and TBA assays, CDAE significantly inhibited lipid peroxidation (P < 0.01). In vivo histopathological studies indicated that CCl4-induced liver injury was alleviated following CDAE treatment in rats of both sexes. CDAE (160 and 320 mg/kg) significantly prevented CCl4-induced elevations of alkaline phosphatase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin levels in rats of both sexes (P < 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001). Moreover, CDAE restored the decreased activities of hepatic antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, as well as non-enzyme antioxidant glutathione, which were induced by CCl4 treatment. CDAE significantly suppressed the up-regulation of CYP2E1 and promoted Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, and gamma-GCSc protein expression. CONCLUSION CDAE exhibits good antioxidant performance in vitro, with marked radical-scavenging and anti-lipid peroxidation activities. CDAE is effective in preventing CCl4-induced hepatic damage in rats of both sexes. The hepatoprotective activity of CDAE may be attributable to its antioxidant activity, which may involve Keap1-Nrf2-mediated antioxidant regulation.

"2008 is the year of creation of the Bitcoin network consisting of a decentralized database, which is storing all transactions of bitcoin tokens, whose quantity is predetermined by a protocol and independent of any authority. The aim of this article is to describe the limits in the use of Bitcoin as medium of exchange. Bitcoin network operation is carried out at high costs of electrical energy consumption, which, will over time be reflected in the price of transactions. Low transaction prices, which is one of the main arguments of Bitcoin promoters, are only possible with continuous issuance of new bitcoins to circulation. Bitcoin's - ""prove of work"" - is the most energetically demanding method from all currently existing methods securing cryptoplatforms. Halving mechanism which reduces the rewards of miners create pressure to decrease hash rate, which is a reflection of the rate of network security. The pressure to decrease hash rate is for now overrun by the increasing efficiency of mining devices. The future will therefore probably bring us fundamental questions: What will it mean for Bitcoin network, if the real costs of running the network will be reflected in costs of transaction? How will Bitcoin network be able to compete with other cryptocurrencies, whose operation is carried out at a much lower cost? Will halving mechanism ultimately cause a declined hash rate, and thereby also a reduction in network security?

"A substantial gap remains between what we know about type 2 diabetes prevention and our ability to apply that knowledge in socially disadvantaged populations at highest risk. This gap results, in part, from a lack of integration between epidemiologic science and social psychology theory, particularly regarding the intersections of stress, self-regulatory health behaviors, and the biological mechanisms underlying the development of diabetes. In this commentary, we describe the utility of a theoretical framework that focuses on the intersection of biological, psychosocial, and environmental contexts as they apply to diabetes disparities, and how such a framework could inform a translational research agenda to reorient prevention efforts to address these inequalities. Such reorientation is needed to ensure that the implementation of prevention efforts does not inadvertently widen diabetes disparities.

"A diet low in poorly absorbed, fermentable, short chain carbohydrates (FODMAPs) is an effective strategy to manage symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The diet has gained traction since its original description in Australia 10 years ago and is now an internationally accepted dietary management strategy for IBS. Randomized controlled trials have raised the profile of the low-FODMAP diet to become a viable first-line therapy for IBS, when implemented under a dietitian's guidance. Importantly, the diagnosis of IBS should be confirmed before commencement of the dietary approach. The skill set of the dietitian is then paramount to the success of the diet. Experience in gastrointestinal disorder management, consideration of symptom types, severity, baseline FODMAP intake, and overall nutritional content and meal pattern are vital in the assessment of the patient. If a strict low-FODMAP diet is deemed necessary, it should only be for an initial period of 4 to 6 weeks. Research suggests that a strict long-term, low-FODMAP diet may negatively impact intestinal microbiome. After the initial strict period, follow up with the dietitian should be conducted to achieve the overall goal-a relaxed FODMAP restriction that enables inclusion of prebiotic FODMAPs while still maintaining symptom relief. The diet will be effective in the vast majority of patients. For those in which it fails, FODMAPs should be reintroduced to the diet, and other dietary (or non-dietary) approaches should be considered.

"Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are regarded as promising therapeutic agents to treat addiction. The current study aimed to examine the effects of huperzine A, a cholinesterase inhibitor, on behavioral sensitization induced by repeated morphine administration and relapse induced by contextual conditioning. The present study also assessed whether the state-dependency hypothesis may explain the results. Adult rats were divided into four groups (n=8) and intraperitoneally injected with 0.2, 0.3 or 0.4 mg/kg huperzine A or saline (1 ml/kg, control), for 5 days. The effect of repeated huperzine A administration alone on locomotor activity was assessed. For the experiments that analyzed the development of morphine-induced sensitization, 40 rats were divided into five groups (n=8): Saline+Saline, Saline+Morphine, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mg/kg huperzine A+Morphine. Following a withdrawal period of 7 days, all animals were administered saline or morphine, as appropriate. To test the state-dependency hypothesis, the rats in the Saline+Morphine group were injected with saline and morphine, while the other three groups were administered different doses of huperzine A and morphine. To examine the effect of huperzine A on the expression of morphine-induced sensitization, the rats in huperzine A+Morphine groups were injected with appropriate concentrations of huperzine A, and morphine. The current results indicated that the administration of huperzine A alone did not affect locomotor activity, while higher doses of huperzine A inhibited the addictive behavior induced by morphine at the development phase. Additionally, huperzine A administration during the expression phase of morphine sensitization did not inhibit the relapse induced by administration of saline. Furthermore, 0.4 mg/kg huperzine A inhibited the expression of morphine-induced behavioral sensitization. Therefore, the results of the current study do not support the state-dependency hypothesis.

"Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) is becoming an epidemic problem in our society, especially among older adults, being known as ""the Silent Epidemic"". People with ABI demand solutions in research that offer them with a relearning process such that they can recover not only their physical skills but also their cognitive abilities. In this context, the inherent characteristics of Ambient Intelligence (AmI), transparency and intelligence, have turned it into one of the best approaches to square up to the impairment that ABI can cause. As AmI proposes the development of context-aware systems that integrate different devices to recognize the context and act accordingly, these systems can react promptly to the needs of people with ABI while they carry out their rehabilitation process. Moreover, the explbitation of a Multi-Agent architecture emerges as a natural solution to develop AmI systems, since agents are reactive, proactive and exhibit an intelligent and autonomous behavior. Therefore, in this paper, a Multi-Agent architecture (MAS) for healthcare Aml systems is presented. It contributes to treat people with ABI by using specific devices to control the patient's movements and some physiological responses, such as the variation of the heart rate, during her rehabilitation process. In this way, the natural relationship between AmI and MAS is exploited. Finally, how this system is used to both design and execute therapies for people with ABI is presented.

"A fully geometrically nonlinear finite element (FE) model is developed using large rotation shell theory for static analysis of composite and piezoelectric laminated thin-walled structures. The proposed large rotation theory is based on the first-order shear deformation (FOSD) hypothesis. It has six independent kinematic parameters which are expressed by five mechanical nodal degrees of freedom (DOFs). Linear electro-mechanically coupled constitutive equations with a constant electric field distribution through the thickness of each smart material layer are considered. Eight-node quadrilateral plate/shell elements with five mechanical DOFs per node and one electrical DOF per smart material layer are employed in the FE modeling. The present large rotation FE model is implemented into static analysis of both composite and piezoelectric laminated plates and shells. The equilibrium equation is solved by Newton-Raphson algorithm with system matrices updated in every iteration. The results are compared with those presented in the literature and others calculated by various simplified nonlinear shell theories. They indicate that large rotation theory has to be considered for the calculation of displacements and sensor output voltages of smart structures undergoing large deflections, since other simplified nonlinear theories fail to predict the static response precisely in many cases.

"Accessible summary What is known on the subject? There is a growing emphasis on communication as a result of the move towards the more inclusive approach associated with the community-based rehabilitation model. Therefore, more importance is attached to handovers. Besides ensuring transfer of information, handovers enhance group cohesion, socialize staff members to the practices of the service and capture its organizational culture. What this paper adds to existing knowledge? While handovers are mainly used for information transfer and to manage the services' daily routine, this paper offers an insight on how handovers can be conceived as valuable instruments to document cultural and organizational change. Only a limited amount of studies has focused on handovers in mental healthcare settings, and most of them only consider the perspectives of psychiatric nurses, while embracing a broader perspective, this paper provides valuable insights into the perspectives of various service providers. The overcoming of the dichotomy deficit-based vs. recovery-oriented model is possible if professionals use handovers to reflect upon their practice and the ways in which their cultural models are affected by the environmental context. What are the implications for practice? Handovers are valuable instruments to document organizational change. It would be important for psychiatric and rehabilitation facilities to keep track of the handover records over time as they may provide insightful information about cultural change and the transformations in the core values and beliefs held by professionals. Abstract Handovers assure a timely and correct information transfer while socializing workers to the service's culture; however, no study describes them as instruments to document organizational change and only a few have focused on psychiatric settings. Aim To investigate the change in the culture of an Italian psychiatric residential care home as perceived by its mental health workers (MHWs) over the course of two decades. Method Emotional text analysis (ETA) was used to analyse the MHWs' handovers completed from 1990 to 2011. Results The analysis generated four clusters and three main factors illustrating the change in the MHWs' representations of the residential care home and its occupants. The factors showed: (1) the shift from an individualistic, problem-focused view to an inclusive, community-based approach; (2) the presence of a descriptive as well as a specialized language; and (3) the presence of a double focus: on patients and professionals. Conclusions Handovers transcripts document the following changes: (1) a shift from a symptom-based to a recovery-oriented approach; (2) a modification of the MHWs values towards an holistic view of the patient; (3) a growing importance assigned to accountability, services integration and teamwork. The paper shows that handovers can be used diachronically to document organizational change.

"Alignment-free methods are one of the mainstays of biological sequence comparison, i.e., the assessment of how similar two biological sequences are to each other, a fundamental and routine task in computational biology and bioinformatics. They have gained popularity since, even on standard desktop machines, they are faster than methods based on alignments. However, with the advent of Next-Generation Sequencing Technologies, datasets whose size, i.e., number of sequences and their total length, is a challenge to the execution of alignment-free methods on those standard machines are quite common. Here, we propose the first paradigm for the computation of k-mer-based alignment-free methods for Apache Hadoop that extends the problem sizes that can be processed with respect to a standard sequential machine while also granting a good time performance. Technically, as opposed to a standard Hadoop implementation, its effectiveness is achieved thanks to the incremental management of a persistent hash table during the map phase, a task not contemplated by the basic Hadoop functions and that can be useful also in other contexts.

"An outbreak of acute hepatitis recently occurred in a nursing home in Zhejiang Province, China. The objectives of this study were to confirm the outbreak and identify the aetiology, source and transmission patterns. All residents and staff in or near the nursing home during the period from 1 October 2014 to 21 May 2015 were investigated regarding hygiene and for epidemiological information including water and food (eating meat especially pork products). Serum and stool specimens were collected for detection of hepatitis E virus (HEV) antibodies using ELISA and RNA using RT-PCR. Samples that were RNA positive were genotyped. Of 185 senior residents and 24 staff in the nursing home, there were 37 laboratory-confirmed cases during the outbreak. Of these cases, 12 patients (three deaths) were symptomatic with jaundice, a common clinical symptom for hepatitis E infection. HEV strains were isolated from three cases and they formed a single cluster within genotype 4d. A case-control study was conducted to investigate potential risk factors for the outbreak and the results revealed that cases more often washed their dishes and rinsed their mouths using tap water than the controls (P < 0.05). Based on hygiene investigation and meteorological information, it is likely that HEV-infected sewage and faeces contaminated the water network on rainy days. Collectively, these results suggest that the outbreak of HEV genotype 4 infection was most likely caused by contaminated tap water rather than food.

"A controversy arose decades ago whether the DG42 gene product expressed during frog embryogenesis synthesized hyaluronan or chitin. Both sets of investigators were correct. It is now possible to understand how prescient those findings were. Synthesis of a seven to nine chitin sugar chain fragment is required before hyaluronan synthesis begins. Thus, DG42 indeed synthesizes both hyaluronan and chitin. Hyaluronan turns over rapidly in vertebrate tissues, but chitin oligomers are difficult to degrade. They accumulate and can cause pathology. Chitin is a simple beta-linked repeating sugar homopolymer found prominently in the building block structures of fungi, molluscs, arthropods, and other forms of invertebrate life. It is a highly resistant insoluble material requiring chitin synthases for production and chitinases for degradation. Mysteriously, chitins and chitinases also occur in vertebrate tissues, while it had previously been assumed that no chitins were contained therein. That assumption is now challenged based on recent biochemical evidence. Chitin does accumulate in many tissues, but may be particularly toxic to neurons. Its accumulation in the brain may account for the cognitive decline found in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The DG42 observations together with the participation of chitins and chitinases in several human diseases, among which in addition to Alzheimer's disease include Gaucher's disease, asthma, and aspects of abnormal immune recognition justify a reexamination of these topics. The purpose of this review is to summarize data in order to place chitins and their attendant enzymes in a rational framework in an attempt to create a cohesive story.

Regarding the red-edge spectral indices, the NDVIreln (using band B5, 705 nm) presented better results compared with B6 (740 nm) and B7 (783 nm) bands. These preliminary results allow us to assume that Sentinel-2 will be a valuable tool for post-fire monitoring. In the future, the two twin Sentinel-2 satellites will offer global coverage of the Madeira Archipelago every five days, therefore allowing the simultaneous study of the evolution of the burnt area and reforestation information with high spatial (up to 10 m) and temporal resolution (5 days).

"An adequate response to global climate change and low carbon economy development has become a worldwide concerned subject. As one of the energetically most intensive industries, construction industry is a key area to promote decarbonization, which is an important path to realize national strategic goals on carbon reduction in China. This paper focuses on low carbon technology integration management, and analyzes the existing research status of green building or low carbon buildings on the related evaluation indexes, then proposes an evaluation system framework for the low carbon technology integration innovation from the perspective of the system management. It points out, that the evaluation of low carbon technology innovation should be conducted by a smarter managing of system resource input, the process control and the system comprehensive performance as an output. Furthermore, based on the questionnaire survey and the exploratory factor analysis result on the selected indexes, this paper implements a rough set method to identify the weight of all the indexes and found that:(1) managers focus more on the affordable input of the beginning stage and the management control in the middle period of the innovation, instead on the output performance in the later stage. This indicates, that the management control during the front stages is more essential than this during the later ones; (2) the constructed evaluation framework, from the system perspective, can properly reflect the integrity, multi -level stakeholder structure and technology integration in low carbon projects, which could support the decision-maker into considering the complexity of construction and evaluation of the technology innovation performance from multi -level perspective; (3) the combined methods, adopted with exploratory factor analysis and rough set evaluation to determine the evaluation index and its weights, could well reflect the overall performance of low carbon project evaluation, the selected indicators have certain scientific and practical effectiveness, which could provide references for enterprise on LCT innovation management. as an industry with a multi -level technologies integration, the single Technological adoption or innovation cannot satisfy the economic transformation requirements of the modern construction industry development. An integration innovation management evaluation model is needed for the sustainability evaluation in the construction practice. Its development is the main scientific objective of this study, by taking into consideration the entire life cycle assessment and various other factors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Approach slabs serve as a transitional system between an approach road and a bridge. Settlement of bridge approach slabs and their supporting backfill has been reported by more than ten Departments of Transportation throughout the United States. According to current Wyoming Department of Transportation inspection reports, bridge approach slab settlements occurred not only on existing bridges but also on newly built bridges that were recently opened to traffic. These settlements typically create voids ranging from 150 mm to 305 mm (6-12 in.) between the base of the approach slab and the geotextile reinforced backfill. This research presents factors causing bridge approach slab settlements and provides appropriate design and construction recommendations. A comprehensive literature review pertaining to approach slabs was performed to examine outcomes of research conducted by 12 states. The current specifications and standards on bridge approach slabs of the corresponding states' Departments of Transportation were also evaluated. A nationwide survey was conducted to fill in the missing knowledge identified in the literature review. The results of the survey are categorized into three groups based on the percentage of bridges experiencing approach slab settlements in that state. Results of the survey show that 46% of the total 28 states are not satisfied with their current approach slab designs. The survey results revealed that the most common cause of approach slab settlement is poor construction practices. The most important finding of the survey is that performing in-situ tests to control backfill compaction reduces the amount of approach slab settlement. Using the lessons learned from the literature and the results of the survey, recommendations were developed for transportation agencies nationwide. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"A digital dead-beat current controller for voltage source converters is presented in this paper. The control structure is specified in a digital hardware description language, synthesized, and deployed on a field-programmable gate array chip. By updating, with negligible computation delay, the duty cycle twice in a switching period, the reference current error is nulled in half a modulation period, so that the controller's small-signal bandwidth is maximized. In addition, due to a simple transient detection circuit, the large-signal response delay is reduced to a small fraction of the modulation period, which is determined by the chosen current signal oversampling rate. The controller can effectively support different voltage-source inverter applications, such as active filters, uninterruptible power supplies, microgrid distributed energy resource controllers, and dc-dc converter applications, including interface converters for renewable energy sources, laboratory battery chargers, and electronic welding machines.

"A systematic and generic procedure for the determination of the reasonable finished state of self-anchored suspension bridges is proposed, the realization of which is mainly through adjustment of the hanger tensions. The initial hanger tensions are first obtained through an iterative analysis by combining the girder-tower-only finite element (FE) model with the analytical program for shape finding of the spatial cable system. These initial hanger tensions, together with the corresponding cable coordinates and internal forces, are then included into the FE model of the total bridge system, the nonlinear analysis of which involves the optimization technique. Calculations are repeated until the optimization algorithm converges to the most optimal hanger tensions (i.e. the desired reasonable finished bridge state). The ""temperature rigid arm"" is introduced to offset the unavoidable initial deformations of the girder and tower, which are due to the huge axial forces originated from the main cable. Moreover, by changing the stiffness coefficient K in the girder-tower-only FE model, the stiffness proportion of the main girder, the tower or the cable subsystem in the whole structural system could be adjusted according to the design intentions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is examined and demonstrated by one simple tutorial example and one self-anchored suspension bridge.

"A new normalized least mean square (NLMS)-based identification algorithm is proposed for sparse systems. In the proposed algorithm, a tap-selection matrix is utilized to adaptively locate the nonzero coefficients during the convergence process. The so-called tap-selection matrix is a diagonal matrix consisting of zeros and ones, with ones indicating the locations of the active coefficients. At each iteration, tap weights update based on the product of the tap-selection matrix and previous tap-weight vector in the NLMS style. The tap-selection matrix updates by comparing each tap weight with a pre-determined threshold value. Parameter choice guidelines for the threshold value are provided to facilitate practical use. Steady-state mean square deviation is also analyzed for performance evaluation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NLMS algorithm with tap-selection matrix can effectively locate the nonzero coefficients of the unknown system impulse response, outperforming the existing NLMS-based algorithms for sparse system identifications.

"Applications of remote sensing using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in agriculture has proved to be an effective and efficient way of obtaining field information. In this study, we validated the feasibility of utilizing multi-temporal color images acquired from a low altitude UAV-camera system to monitor real-time wheat growth status and to map within-field spatial variations of wheat yield for smallholder wheat growers, which could serve as references for site-specific operations. Firstly, eight orthomosaic images covering a small winter wheat field were generated to monitor wheat growth status from heading stage to ripening stage in Hokkaido, Japan. Multi-temporal orthomosaic images indicated straightforward sense of canopy color changes and spatial variations of tiller densities. Besides, the last two orthomosaic images taken from about two weeks prior to harvesting also notified the occurrence of lodging by visual inspection, which could be used to generate navigation maps guiding drivers or autonomous harvesting vehicles to adjust operation speed according to specific lodging situations for less harvesting loss. Subsequently orthomosaic images were geo-referenced so that further study on stepwise regression analysis among nine wheat yield samples and five color vegetation indices (CVI) could be conducted, which showed that wheat yield correlated with four accumulative CVIs of visible-band difference vegetation index (VDVI), normalized green-blue difference index (NGBDI), green-red ratio index (GRRI), and excess green vegetation index (ExG), with the coefficient of determination and RMSE as 0.94 and 0.02, respectively. The average value of sampled wheat yield was 8.6 t/ha. The regression model was also validated by using leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) method, of which root-mean-square error of predication (RMSEP) was 0.06. Finally, based on the stepwise regression model, a map of estimated wheat yield was generated, so that within-field spatial variations of wheat yield, which was usually seen as general information on soil fertility, water potential, tiller density, etc., could be better understood for applications of site-specific or variable-rate operations. Average yield of the studied field was also calculated according to the map of wheat yield as 7.2 t/ha.

The purpose of this study was to develop an attitude scale assessing university students' attitudes towards computer programming. In the first phase, the scale was administered to 522 university students. Explanatory factor analysis yielded three dimensions: affection, cognition, and behavior. In the second phase, final version of the 18 item-scale was administered to 553 university students. Results of confirmatory factor analysis provided evidence for the factorial structure of the scale. The Cronbach alpha coefficients ranged from 0.80 to 0.90.

"A 3-D network-on-chip (NoC) enables the design of high performance and low power many-core chips. Existing 3-D NoCs are inadequate for meeting the ever-increasing performance requirements of many-core processors since they are simple extensions of regular 2-D architectures and they do not fully exploit the advantages provided by 3-D integration. Moreover, the anticipated performance gain of a 3-D NoC-enabled many-core chip may be compromised due to the potential failures of through-silicon-vias that are predominantly used as vertical interconnects in a 3-D IC. To address these problems, we propose a machine-learning-inspired predictive design methodology for energy-efficient and reliable many-core architectures enabled by 3-D integration. We demonstrate that a small-world network-based 3-D NoC (3-D SWNoC) performs significantly better than its 3-D MESH-based counterparts. On average, the 3-D SWNoC shows 35% energy-delay-product improvement over 3-D MESH for the PARSEC and SPLASH2 benchmarks considered in this paper. To improve the reliability of 3-D NoC, we propose a computationally efficient spare-vertical link (sVL) allocation algorithm based on a state-space search formulation. Our results show that the proposed sVL allocation algorithm can significantly improve the reliability as well as the lifetime of 3-D SWNoC.

"A correspondence is a set of mappings that establishes a relation between the elements of two data structures (i.e. sets of points, strings, trees or graphs). If we consider several correspondences between the same two structures, one option to define a representative of them is through the generalised median correspondence. In general, the computation of the generalised median is an NP-complete task. In this paper, we present two methods to calculate the generalised median correspondence of multiple correspondences. The first one obtains the optimal solution in cubic time, but it is restricted to the Hamming distance. The second one obtains a sub-optimal solution through an iterative approach, but does not have any restrictions with respect to the used distance. We compare both proposals in terms of the distance to the true generalised median and runtime.

"Access to Recovery (ATR) is a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)-funded initiative that offers a mix of clinical and supportive services for substance abuse. ATR clients choose which services will help to overcome barriers in their road to recovery, and a recovery consultant provides vouchers and helps link the client to these community resources. One of ATR's goals was to provide services to those involved in the criminal justice system in the hopes that addressing substance abuse issues could reduce subsequent criminal behaviors. This study examines this goal by looking at recidivism among a sample of clients in one state's ATR program who returned to the community after incarceration. Results suggest that there were few differential effects of service selections on subsequent recidivism. However, there are significant differences in recidivism rates among the agencies that provided ATR services. Agencies with more resources and a focus on prisoner reentry had better recidivism outcomes than those that focus only on substance abuse services.

"A 1 kW scale kite-powered system that uses kites to convert wind energy into electrical energy has been studied to determine its performance characteristics and establish feasibility of steady-state operation. In this kite-powered system, a kite is connected to a tether that transmits the generated aerodynamic forces on the kite to a power conversion system on the ground. The ground-based power conversion system consists of a rocking arm coupled to a Sprag clutch, flywheel, and electrical generator. Governing equations describing the dynamical motion of the kite, tether, and power conversion mechanism were developed assuming an inflexible, straight-line tether. A steady-state analysis of the kite aerodynamics was incorporated into the dynamical equations of the kite-powered system. The governing equations were solved numerically using a Runge-Kutta scheme to assess how performance parameters of the system such as output power, cycle time, and tether tension varied with wind speed, kite area, and aerodynamic characteristics of the kite. The results showed that a 1 kW scale system is feasible using the proposed design concept with a kite area of 25 m(2) and wind speeds of 6 m/s.

"A pedestrian suspension bridge over Walker Creek near Route 749 in Giles County, Virginia, partially collapsed in October of 2008, causing 10 people to fall into the creek below. The failure occurred when one of the anchors holding a suspension cable fractured. This paper presents the investigation of the failure, including a structural analysis of the bridge to determine cable forces, material property testing of the fractured anchor, laboratory testing of a different anchor from the bridge, and a simple strength evaluation of the anchor under combined axial force and moment. Based on the results of the study, it was concluded that the anchor should not have failed carrying the loads on the bridge on the day of failure. The anchor failed in brittle fracture because of a local defect in the material at the perimeter of a corrosion pit on the surface of the anchor hook. The structural analysis and laboratory testing indicated that the material around the defect was at yield before fracture initiation. The material flaws significantly influenced the bridge failure after yielding and inelastic deformation of the anchor material at the inside of the hook radius occurred.

To fulfill the application requirements, these systems are characterized by complex multilayer architectures, extending from pulse width modulation (PWM) and current control loops up to global optimization and high level communication functions. The complexity and the wide variability of the different layer implementations make digital control mandatory. However, developing so complex digital controllers on conventional hardware platforms, like digital signal processors (DSPs) or even FPGAs, is not the most practical choice.

Furthermore, this paper proposes hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulation as an effective means of developing and debugging complex hardware and software codesigned controllers.

"Although extensive research has investigated the benefits of green buildings very little is known about user perception and satisfaction. Most of the studies involving users in green buildings are in the form of post-occupancy evaluations that gather satisfaction scores and qualitative feedback from building occupants. However it is difficult to generalize these individual case studies to a wider discussion of preferences for green building attributes. The current research uses a more generalizable technique to examine occupants' experiences in green buildings. This study identifies the relative importance of environmental and experiential design categories by occupants based on lived experiences in the space. The article provides the results of a Choice-Based Conjoint (CBC) study that compares responses from green and non-green building occupants. The results provide novel insights into the degree of importance of experiential categories of design, such as social territories, visual, and non-visual aesthetics, compared with environmental categories of design, such as energy efficiency, water savings, and indoor environmental quality. The article contributes to the green building design literature by evaluating green buildings from a new perspective that is based on users' preferences.

The seawall is located along the 1967-74 erosion scarps and extends for much of the length of the developed shoreline of the Gold Coast. In combination with beach nourishment these terminal seawalls are an integral part of the long-term management of Gold Coast beaches. The standard seawall design and alignment were adopted by the City in the early 1970s with the only structural design change in over 40 years being an option in the 1980's replacing the clay / shale tertiary layer with geotextile. The status investigations were aimed at evaluating the present condition and damage modes of the existing seawalls after long term service. Methods included potholing, Ground Penetrating Radar and excavation / peel back of the armour layers. The review found that the standard seawall designs conformed to present standards but upgrading in the future would be required.

The photo conversion efficiencies of the electrodes fabricated by variation in the dopant concentration in the range 10(-4)-10(-1)% of Fe have been estimated and compared. The doping enabled to control the charge dynamics in ZnO photoanode to yield enhanced photocurrent. The photo electrochemical hydrogen evolution under solar-photons from the doped photoanode was 17-times larger in magnitude i.e. similar to 307 mu mol/h, than un-doped film electrodes (18 mu mol/h). The film exhibited wurtzite structure (Space Group - P63mc) which did not show any structural lattice deformation after Fe doping of <= 10(-1)%. Optical studies revealed a red-shift in the band-gap, while a decrease in the absorption-coefficient, with the increase in Fe concentration. These photoanodes also displayed higher Incident-Photon-Current-Conversion efficiency (IPCE) in the 400-430 nm wavelength range.

"A hybrid solar energy conversion system described in this study is designed to exceed the efficiency of each type of technology alone by combining advantages of concentrated solar power (CSP) technology and high performance concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) cells. This hybrid system can be tilted at different inclination angles to track the solar power at different latitudes and different time zones. Thermal management is important to CPV cells, as 1000x concentrated solar radiation onto CPV not only leads to higher performance but also generates more waste heat flux. In this work, the effects of natural convection with and without the interaction of surface radiation in the system consisting of PV cells, optical funnels and a heatsink were numerically investigated with an experimentally validated model. The influence of inclination on the overall flow structure and heat transfer was examined. Under the effect of these funnels, the heat transfer was enhanced when the heat was transferred through PV cells to funnels. At the same time, the separation flow between the spaces of funnels would take the heat to the ambient. The minimum average temperature of surrogate PV cells occurred at the inclination angle of 60Ltd. When the inclination angle varied from 0 degrees to 90 degrees, the stagnation point moved from the downward surface of the heat sink towards the edge of heat sink. From 0 degrees to 60 degrees, the stagnation point was at the downward surface of heat sink and there was a dramatic decrease in the average temperature of the surrogate PV cells. When inclination angles were less than 60 degrees, except that there was a separation region above substrate, the side flow could flow in and out freely between adjacent funnels and then formed a pair of separation bubble, or spiral node, on top of the funnels. At these inclination angles, flow velocity was found to be the dominant factor influencing heat transfer because the flow pattern (separation bubble) was the same on top of the funnels. However, at inclination angles of 60 degrees to 90 degrees the stagnation point occurred at the edge of the heat sink, and the surrogate PV temperature increased. When the inclination angle reached 90, the flow was trapped and recirculated among funnels, and the vortical wake on top of the funnel disappeared. It can be concluded that from 60 degrees to 90 degrees, the dominant factor influencing heat transfer is funnel effect because the flow velocity stayed almost constant. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Background An acute hospital-based elderly care rehabilitation service evolved over a 9-year period from a traditional consultant/junior doctor configuration to a consultant/advanced nurse practitioner configuration. The review evaluated the advanced nurse practitioner team's role in the clinical setting, and the constraints experienced as a result of the traditions of the hospital organization. Evaluation The review drew its conclusions from opinion data collected from 38 professionals and non-professionals within the rehabilitation service. Key issues The organizational infrastructure and traditions that had an impact on service delivery by the advanced nurse practitioner team. There is a demand for senior management to act on developmental constraints. Conclusions The advanced nurse practitioner-led rehabilitation service was fit for purpose and an emerging model of a non-medical led care. However, important organizational constraints were identified. Implications for nursing management An advanced nurse practitioner team, working in collaboration with medical consultants, was a model for future service redesign in the acute hospital setting. Nevertheless, it presented challenges to senior health-care managers on current organizational infrastructures.

"A planning methodology is introduced to ensure that workers on construction sites remain at a safe distance from each other. The methodology is based on the assumption that hazardous conditions, which occur on sites due to the proximity of different workers, depend on the interaction between both reinforcing and counteracting characteristics of the workers. The methodology includes a matrix-based method for the definition of minimum safe distances between workers, and the use of 3D time-space diagrams to represent and analyze the dynamic movements of workers on site. The methodology is implemented in a real case study in order to verify its feasibility. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"A very frequently asked question regarding all types of geosynthetics is, ` How long will they last?' This paper answers the question for exposed geotextiles and geomembranes, assuming that they were properly designed and installed. Furthermore, it compares these new results to the earlier lifetime prediction results of a covered geomembrane. Nonexposed (or covered) lifetime conditions for a 1.5 mm thick high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane have previously been evaluated and published. Landfill incubation devices at four elevated temperatures of 85, 75, 65 and 55 degrees C were used in the prediction in order to reach 50% of retained strength and elongation. Considering the three stages of (i) depletion of antioxidants, (ii) induction time, and (iii) 50% reduction in mechanical properties, the lifetime extrapolation was made down to 20 degrees C. The 50% reduction value (called halflife throughout the paper) for this geomembrane under these conditions was approximately 450 years. Since the laboratory incubation times took 12 years, other nonexposed geosynthetics were not evaluated under the supposition that the covered situation is generally a moot point for most geosynthetics in their customary applications. For exposed (or uncovered) geosynthetics, however, the situation is quite different. Ultraviolet radiation, elevated temperature and full oxygen are available, which shortens the service lifetime, but how much? For evaluation of this situation, the authors utilized laboratory ultraviolet fluorescent tube weathering devices, as per ASTM D7238, for incubation purposes. Seven different geotextiles and five different geomembranes were evaluated. Each material was incubated at 80, 70 and 60 degrees C until a 50% reduction of strength and elongation occurred. The data was then extrapolated down to 20 degrees C for laboratory halflife values and for comparison with the nonexposed condition. The ratio of nonexposed to exposed lifetime for HDPE geomembranes is approximately seven. The calculations for the 12 exposed geosynthetics then progressed to using site-specific radiation to obtain an equivalent field halflife. Phoenix, Arizona, conditions are illustrated although the procedure is applicable worldwide. Halflife predictions for the geotextiles vary from a few months for the needle punched nonwovens to up to 10 years for monofilaments and high antioxidant formulated products. Results for geomembranes vary from 47 to 97 years, with HDPE being the highest. These exposed halflife results (which took 12 years of laboratory incubation to achieve) are felt to be most interesting and are presented for the first time to an international audience.

"Aging may enhance both oxidative stress and bone-marrow mesenchymal stem-cell (MSC) differentiation into adipocytes. That reduces osteoblastogenesis, thus favoring bone-mass loss and fracture, representing an important worldwide health-issue, mainly in countries with aging populations. Intake of antioxidant products may help to retain bone-mass density. Interestingly, a novel olive-pomace physical treatment to generate olive oil also yields by-products rich in functional antioxidants. Thus, diet of postmenopausal women was supplemented for two months with one of such by-products (distillate 6; D6), being rich in squalene. After treatment, serum from such women showed reduced both lipidic peroxidation and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Besides, vitamin E and coenzyme Q10 levels increased. Furthermore, culture medium containing 10% of such serum both increased osteoblastogenesis and reduced adipogenesis in human MSC from bone marrow. Therefore, highly antioxidant by-products like D6 may represent a relevant source for development of functional products, for both prevention and treatment of degenerative pathologies associated with aging, like osteoporosis.

"A street lighting system designed with features to detect critical functional problems using data fusion concepts is presented. With measurements of rms voltage, active power and power factor, an intelligent algorithm is capable of define some system anomalies: failed lamps, power line theft, high and low voltage, and low power factor, this besides the typical measurements of power consumption. The algorithm is based on statistical inference and fuzzy logic to achieve fusion of measured data with the capability of adjusting the membership functions for different street lighting systems ( different number of lamps and power consumption). The system with the above mentioned faults was simulated with the Monte Carlo method before its implementation in two real street lighting systems. The algorithm was implemented in a microcomputer Raspberry Pi B+ in Python language including tele-management capabilities. The algorithm design aspects, its implementation, and the comparison of simulated versus real measured values are presented.

"An innovative and highly efficient random vibration series of algorithms - the pseudo-excitation method (PEM) - and its effective applications in bridge dynamics are presented. PEM transforms stationary random vibration equations into simple harmonic vibration equations; and transforms non-stationary random vibration equations into ordinary equations of motion of structures subjected to deterministic time-history loading. Therefore not only are the solution processes considerably simplified, but also the computational effort is greatly reduced while the numerical results remain highly accurate. This method has now been widely used in the Chinese engineering community, and has been adopted and recommended by the Chinese official Guidelines for Seismic Design of Highway Bridges (2008). It has also been described in detail in the Vibration and Shock Handbook (2005, CRC Press) and the Bridge Engineering Handbook (2013, CRC Press). By means of PEM, 3D flutter-buffet CQC-based analysis has been successfully performed for the 1650m main-span Xihoumen bridge, the second longest suspension bridge in the world, located in the well-known typhoon region Zhou-Shan Islands, in the East China Sea. In addition, PEM has also become a widely-used research and design tool for vehicle engineering in China, including vehicle-bridge dynamic interaction problems. A finite element model for power spectral analysis of a high-speed train coach with 720924 degrees of freedom is presented. Along with a brief introduction to PEM, this presentation will also show a number of practical engineering examples which have successfully used PEM in the related research and design.

"Accelerating the integration of a joint replacement or the healing of a bone fracture, particularly a complicated non-union fracture, would improve patient welfare and decrease healthcare costs. Currently, an autologous bone graft is the gold standard method for the treatment of complicated non-union fractures, but it is not always possible to harvest such a graft. A proactive highly inductive so-called smart material approach is pertinent in these cases. In this study, the surface chemistry of a previously approved material with desirable bulk material properties was modified to investigate its potential as an economical and effective alternative. The objective was to create stable synthetic chemical coatings that could guide cells along the osteogenic lineage required to generate mineralised tissue that would induce and accelerate bone healing. Primary human osteoblast-like cells were cultured in vitro for 7, 14 and 28 days on amine-terminated (chain length in the range 3-11) silane-modified glass surfaces with controlled nanotopography, to determine how surface chemistry and nanotopography change osteoblast function. The materials were characterised using atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), water contact angle (WCA) and a novel ninhydrin assay. The cells were analysed using qRT-PCR, von Kossa tinctural staining for mineralisation, and visualised using both transmitted white light and electron microscopy. Bone-like nodules, quantified using microscopy, only formed on the short-chain (chain length 3 and 4) amines after 7 days, as did the up-regulation of sclerostin, suggestive of a more mature osteoblast phenotype. In this paper, we report more rapid nodule formation than has previously been observed, without the addition of exogenous factors in the culture medium. This suggests that the coating would improve the integration of implants with bone or be the basis of a smart biomaterial that would accelerate the bone regeneration process.

"Aggressive NK cell leukemia (ANKL) is an exceedingly rare form of leukemia and carries a poor prognosis, with a median survival of only 2 months. Using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database, we evaluated outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) in patients with ANKL. Twenty-one patients with a centrally confirmed diagnosis of ANKL were included. Median patient age was 42 years and 15 patients (71%) were Caucasian. Fourteen patients (67%) were in complete remission (CR) at the time of alloHCT, and 5 patients had active disease. Median follow-up of survivors was 25 months (range, 12 to 116). The 2-year estimates of nonrelapse mortality, relapse/progression, progression free (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were 21%, 59%, 20%, and 24%, respectively. The 2-year PFS of patients in CR at the time of alloHCT was significantly better than that of patients with active disease at transplantation (30% versus 0%; P = .001). The 2-year OS in similar order was 38% versus 0% (P < .001). In conclusion, this registry analysis that included majority non-Asian patient population shows that alloHCT can provide durable disease control in a subset of ANKL patients. Achieving CR before transplantation appears to be a prerequisite for successful transplantation outcomes. (C) 2017 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

"A pilot mindfulness home intervention was conducted for 6 weeks among 8-12-year-old children born with esophageal atresia and their parents. Participants were randomly assigned to a waiting list control (WLC) group (n = 8) and an experimental group (n = 12). When all participants had completed the mindfulness-based program, data were pooled and treated for the entire sample (n = 19). Self-assessment measures included the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale for Adolescents (MAAS-A), the Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM), the modified Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Child (STAI-C), the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), and the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire Kids version (CERQ-k). Parental assessment measures included the modified STAI-C. The results underlined the program's feasibility and acceptability. Clinical effects of the mindfulness-based program were observed. Self-assessed data for children who had practiced mindfulness compared to the WLC group showed increased mindfulness and decreased depression. Reduced anxiety was found in all groups. Positive affect tended to improve from pre-test to post-test in children who had practiced mindfulness compared to the WLC group. Parental assessments showed significant improvement in positive affect and decreases in anxiety and negative affect in the intervention group compared to the WLC group. Cognitive emotion regulation strategies were also affected by the mindfulness-based program. Rumination scores significantly decreased from pre-test to post-test in the intervention group. This preliminary study suggests that regular mindfulness practice presents a promising approach to reducing the burden of this neonatal malformation.

"A multiscale approach is pursued to develop a modified shear-lag model for capturing size-scale effects on electrostatic potential generated by a zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire (NW) in a nanocomposite electrical generator (NCEG). The size-scale effect on elastic modulus of ZnO NWs is captured using a core-surface model. Closed form of governing equations is derived considering linear elasticity for axisymmetric problem and cylindrical coordinate system. Two different configurations based on parallel and series connecting of NCEGs for application in NEMS/MEMS devices are also studied. Parametric studies are performed for sample cases to demonstrate application of the developed model. It is shown that aspect ratio and diameter of NWs are crucial controlling parameters for determining the performance of nanocomposite electrical generators. Numerical results disclose that there is an optimum aspect ratio for each NW of specific diameter. It was also shown that despite the symmetry of loading with respect to mid-plane normal to the NW's axis, the electric potential is not symmetric.(C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"A simple and accurate scheme for modeling microstructures is proposed with the help of element trimming, combined with signed distance function based boundary smoothing. To accommodate randomly distributed fibers in unidirectional composites, digital image processing is used. The interfaces of multi materials are identified by introducing a signed distance function, and then, square background elements crossing the interfaces are simply trimmed and divided to represent a single material behavior by a single element. After element trimming, the elements that are polygon-shaped in the two-dimensional domain are split into conventional three-node triangle elements (six-node prism elements in the three-dimensional domain) available in many commercial software packages. The present modeling scheme was verified through benchmark examples in terms of the accuracy and efficiency and then applied to the modeling of unidirectional composites based on real microscopic images to evaluate the equivalent elastic properties.

"Algorithms are hard to understand for novice computer science students because they dynamically modify values of elements of abstract data structures. Animations can help to understand algorithms, since they connect abstract concepts to real life objects and situations. In the past 30-35 years, there have been conducted many experiments in the field of usage of animations and visualizations in education, but they showed mixed results. In this paper, we review past research within the field and summarize recommendations regarding the graphic design and interactivity of the animations. In the second part of the paper, we present our interactive card sorting animations with conceptual views. The goal of these animations is to help students understand the main ideas and differences between basic sorting algorithms. In a pedagogical experiment related to these animations, 92 first-year computer science students of J. Selye University in Komarno (Slovakia) were asked to fill in a pre-test, experiment with the interactive animations, and fill in a post-test. The results showed that animations helped students to understand essential aspects of sorting algorithms. However, the participants were not able to understand the sorting algorithms in detail, so other types of animations are needed to teach algorithms in-depth.

"A full software radio receiver is supposed to receive any signals in a wide band within a range from 0 to 5 GHz. But, linearity constraints are very strong because of all the non-idealities of such a complex system. Those non-idealities generate some undesired signals (interferers) leading to a degradation of reception. They can be counteracted by compensation. This paper proposes a mixed system of wide-band linearization consisting in an analog spectral sensor (SASP), a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) and an analog compensation signal generator. High-level simulation results in VHDL-AMS language exhibits a rejection of 60dB for continuous wave (CW) interferers.

"A portable tester for accessing human skin status quantitatively at home is reported. An interdigital electrode (IDE) that contacts directly with human skin is used as the sensing element. The electrode-skin model is simplified as a resistance and a capacitance in series. Using square wave signal for excitation, impedance of the IDE is measured in a charging/discharging way. During one measurement cycle, the response voltages at two excitation frequencies, i.e., 10 kHz and 600 Hz, are measured successively. Equivalent resistance and capacitance of skin are then resolved from the measured values. Both the numerical and experimental simulation results indicate that the proposed circuit and corresponding algorithms work well for resistors and capacitors. The performance of the tester is experimentally tested with human skin in cases of different status. Obvious relationship between the measured values and the skin status is observed. Moreover, distinctive results are obtained between hydrating and emollient cosmetics smeared skins. The tester can be potentially used to give a quantitative guidance for individual skin care, such as cosmetics selection.

"Although various factors have been identified as important for a successful briefing process, few studies appear to have undertaken a comprehensive analysis using factor analysis to systematically categorize the views of professionals on the relative importance of briefing process critical success factors (CSFs). This paper is intended to fill this research gap. A survey was conducted in Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia to collect the opinions of construction professionals regarding CSFs for construction project briefing. Through factor analysis, reliability, and validity analyses, the following seven CSFs were established: (1)client's business, organization, and project requirements; (2)requirements of stakeholders; (3)knowledge, experience, and cultural background of the stakeholders; (4)decision making and management skills of the senior project managers; (5)competence of the design team; (6)balanced interest of the stakeholders; and (7)the process of briefing. Although this research study involves a limited sample size, the survey findings and hands-on experience of the relevant industrial practitioners can be cross referenced to similar investigations in other parts of the world for international comparisons. The CSFs systematically identified and categorized enable practitioners in the construction industry to manage the briefing process successfully.

"A discretization method is proposed for a rather general class of nonlinear continuous-time systems, which can have a piecewise-constant input, such as one under digital control via a zero-order-hold device. The resulting discrete-time model is expressed as a product of the integration-gain and the system function that governs the dynamics of the original continuous-time system. This is made possible with the use of the delta or Euler operator and makes comparisons of discrete and continuous time systems quite simple, since the difference between the two forms is concentrated into the integration-gain. This gain is determined in the paper by using the Riccati approximation of a certain gain condition that is imposed on the discretized system to be an exact model. The method is shown to produce a smaller error norm than one uses the linear approximation. Simulations are carried out for a Lotka-Volterra and an averaged van der Pol nonlinear systems to show the superior performance of the proposed model to ones known to be online computable, such as the forward-difference, Kahan's, and Mickens' methods. Insights obtained should be useful for developing digital control laws for nonlinear continuous-time systems, which is currently limited to the simplest forward-difference model.

"A quantitative and qualitative increase in production has been obtained in most fields through the development of CPUs and real-time systems based on them. Such is the case in the industrial sector where the automation process relieved partly or wholly the human activities needed in the manufacturing process. This is mainly due to time sharing in embedded real-time systems and to pseudo-parallel execution of tasks in the implementation of a single central processing unit. The present article presents the validation of the nHSE (Hardware Scheduler Engine) scheduler implemented in hardware by using a FPGA Xilinx Virtex-7, Vivado development platform, and the Vivado Simulator. In this context, our main contribution relates to a custom interrupt management scheduling policy implemented in hardware at the nHSE level, in order to provide predictable execution for asynchronous interrupts. By reducing the jitter when handling with asynchronous interrupts and completely eliminating the uncertainties of the scheduling limit for the set of tasks, a significant improvement of the overall system's predictability has been obtained.

"Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems based on sensor technologies are seen as key enablers to an ageing society. However, most approaches in this space do not provide a truly generic ambient space - one that is not only capable of assisting people with diverse medical conditions, but can also recognise the habits of healthy habitants, as well as those with developing medical conditions. The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) is key to the understanding and provisioning of appropriate and efficient care. However, ADL recognition is particularly difficult to achieve in multi-resident spaces; especially with single-mode (albeit carefully crafted) solutions, which only have limited capabilities.

"Aim Limited data exist on Crohn's disease (CD)-associated small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA). A large-scale retrospective cohort study was conducted comparing the clinical features and outcome of CD-associated SBA and de novo SBA. Method Data for patients with small bowel adenocarcinoma were gathered from the 1992-2010 United States Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results cancer registry- Medicare linked database. We identified 2123 patients, of whom 179 had CD-associated and 1944 de novo SBA. The main outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Results CD-associated SBA was most commonly located in the ileum (62% vs 31%, P < 0.0001). CD patients were diagnosed at an earlier stage (I/II), compared with de novo SBA (55% vs 32%, P < 0.0001), and were more likely to undergo surgery (81% vs 72%, P = 0.0016). Chemotherapy use was similar (25% vs 21%, P = 0.1886). Patients with CD-associated SBA had better 5-year OS (43% vs 34%, P = 0.0121) but a similar CSS (65% vs 64%, P = 0.77). There was no difference in the OS between the cohorts when stratified by stage. On multivariate analysis, CD was not significantly related to OS [hazard ratio (HR) 0.97, 95% CI: 0.79-1.20, P = 0.7889]. Surgery and the extent of lymphadenectomy improved OS for all SBA patients (HR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60-0.88, P = 0.001), whereas chemotherapy did not (HR 1.13, 95% CI: 0.99-1.28, P = 0.0665). Conclusion Patients with CD-associated SBA present at an earlier stage than patients with de novo SBA, they receive more surgery but similar rates of chemotherapy, and have similar OS and CSS.

LEM includes a machine learning method such as the decision trees that makes a distinction between high- and low-fitness areas in the design space. The learning process can detect the right directions of the evolution and lead to high steps in the evolution of the individuals.

In order to improve the design accuracy, bsim3v3 CMOS transistor model is adopted in this proposed design method. This proposed design method is tested on three different operational amplifier circuits. The performance of this proposed design method is verified by comparing it with the evolutionary strategy algorithm and other similar methods.

"A national study of exercise related morbidity (ERM) in England and Wales was carried out using a postal questionnaire sent to 28857 adults aged 16-45 years. The questionnaire asked about regular participation in sports or other recreational fitness activities involving physical exercise, and for details of any injuries occurring during a 28 d reference period. A return rate of 68% was achieved. Comparisons with other national data sources indicated that the information obtained was reliable. It is estimated that each year there are 29 million incidents resulting in new or recurrent injuries, however minor, of which 9.8 million (95% confidence interval 8.1 to 11.4 million) result in new 'substantive' injuries which are potentially serious, result in treatment, or in participants being unable to take part in their usual activities. Soccer accounted for more than 25% of ail ERM, but the risk of a substantive injury in rugby was three times that in soccer. Over one third of ERR-I occurred in men aged 16-25 years.

"Ailanthus altissima pollen (AAP) is considered as an emerging cause of respiratory allergy in United States, Italy and Iran. However, the allergenic composition of AAP is still unknown and has yet to be characterized. The present study aimed to identify AAP allergens using a proteomics-based approach. For this purpose, optimized AAP protein extracts were analyzed using 1D- and 2D- gel electrophoresis and confronted to twenty sera from individuals with respiratory allergy during the AAP season. Candidate allergens were detected using the serum from an allergic patient with clinical history of AAP pollinosis. IgE-binding spots were identified using MALDI-TOF/OF mass spectrometry and database searching. According to our results, AAP extracts were rich in proteins (up to 16.25 mg/ml) with a molecular-weight distribution ranging from 10 to 175 kDa. Two-D electrophoresis of AAP extracts revealed 125 protein spots from which 13 were IgE reactive. These IgE-binding proteins were identified as enolase, calreticulin, probable pectate lyase 6, conserved hypothetical protein and ras-related protein RHN1-like. By our knowledge, this study is the first report identifying AAP allergens. These findings will open up further avenues for the diagnosis and immunotherapy of the AAP allergy as well as for the cloning and molecular characterization of relevant allergens. Biological significance: Ailanthus altissima colonizes new areas every year in Iran and is spreading aggressively worldwide. According to USDA, the tree of heaven is now present as an invasive plant in 30 states in US (www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/plants/treeheaven.shtml) and come to dominate large areas in many regions. Up to now, several cases of allergy to A. altissima pollen have been reported in United States, Italy and Iran [14]. However, there is still no information on the sensitizing allergens and the molecular origin of these clinical symptoms, which constitutes a serious threat to patients suffering from respiratory allergies in these regions. To our knowledge, the current study describes, therefore, the first panel of proteins responsible for IgE-mediated A. altissima pollinosis by using a gel-based proteomic approach. This work represents the pioneer proteomic investigation on Simaroubaceae spp. and provides useful insights for further studies on the allergens of this widely distributed plant family.

"A smart acidochromic agarose-based film with 1,4-bis(para-hydroxystyryl)benzene as the pH-responsive fluorophore was prepared. This film can simultaneously harness the chemical potential of light and aerial humidity gradients to convert them into mechanical work. The strong reversible hygroscopicity of the agarose matrix induces swift locomotion by mechanical deformation owing to exchange of water with the surroundings. Driven by humidity, a 20mg composite film coupled to a piezoelectric bending transducer sensor generates a peak output of approximately 80mV, which corresponds to a power density of 25Wkg(-1). Excitation with UV light triggers isomerization of the chromophore, which appears as reshaping by spiraling, bending, or twisting of the film. The material also responds to changes in the pHvalue by reversible protonation of the fluorophore with rapid changes in color and fluorescence.

"Adaptive-like expansions of natural killer (NK) cell subsets are known to occur in response to human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. These expansions are typically made up of NKG2C(+) NK cells with particular killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) expression patterns. Such NK cell expansion patterns are also seen in patients with viral hepatitis infection. Yet, it is not known if the viral hepatitis infection promotes the appearance of such expansions or if effects are solely attributed to underlying CMV infection. In sizeable cohorts of CMV seropositive hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infected patients, we analyzed NK cells for expression of NKG2A, NKG2C, CD57, and inhibitory KIRs to assess the appearance of NK cell expansions characteristic of what has been seen in CMV seropositive healthy individuals. Adaptive like NK cell expansions observed in viral hepatitis patients were strongly associated with CMV seropositivity. The number of subjects with these expansions did not differ between CMV seropositive viral hepatitis patients and corresponding healthy controls. Hence, we conclude that adaptive-like NK cell expansions observed in HBV, HCV, and/or HDV infected individuals are not caused by the chronic hepatitis infections per se, but rather are a consequence of underlying CMV infection.

"Aim: This study reports structural modeling, molecular dynamics profiling of hypothetical proteins in Chlamydia abortus genome database. Methodology: The hypothetical protein sequences were extracted from C. abortus LLG Genome Database for functional elucidation using in silico methods. Results: Fifty-one proteins with their roles in defense, binding and transporting other biomolecules were unraveled. Forty-five proteins were found to be nonhomologous to proteins present in hosts infected by C. abortus. Of these, 31 proteins were related to virulence. The structural modeling of two proteins, first, WP_006344020.1 (phosphorylase) and second, WP_006344325.1 (chlamydial protease/proteasome-like activity factor) were accomplished. The conserved active sites necessary for the catalytic function were analyzed. Conclusion: The finally concluded proteins are envisioned as possible targets for developing drugs to curtail chlamydial infections, however, and should be validated by molecular biological methods. [GRAPHICS] Lay abstract: Sequencing technologies have generated abundant data on genome and proteins of an organism. The hypothetical proteins are those whose existence is predicted by computational analysis of genes or protein sequences, but practical evidence to prove them are lacking. This study predicts functions of hypothetical proteins in Chlamydia abortus by computational and bioinformatics methods, determining their 3D structures by structural genomics, homology modeling with known proteins and annotating possible catalytic sites. These findings may be helpful for evolving strategies to curtail Chlamydia abortus infection.

"A small scale thermoacoustic Stirling engine (TASHE) is simulated according to the linear thermoacoustic theory. The computed results show that in a small scale thermoacoustic Stirling heat engine, the diameter of the resonance tube might have important influences on the working frequency and the performance of the engine, which are always neglected in a large scale system. Likewise, the analysis and experimental results show that in order to obtain better engine performance, the diameter of the resonance tube must be chosen appropriately according to the looped tube dimension and the input heating power. This provides an effective way to miniaturize the thermoacoustic Stirling heat engine. According to the computation and analysis, a small scale engine was built, the resonance tube length and diameter of which were about 350 mm and 20 mm, respectively, and the working frequency was about 282 Hz. When the input heating power was about 637 W, the maximal peak to peak pressure amplitude and pressure ratio reached 0.22 MPa and 1.116, respectively, which were able to drive a thermoacoustic refrigerator or an electrical generator.

"Accurate determination of the protons energy in radiotherapy planning can be achieved if the stopping power of protons to specific body tissue are known. The Bethe-Bloch equation greatly aid the understanding of how to calculate the stopping power from the physics point of view, but not so practical and easy to be applied on radiotherapy planning system that involves many computational calculations and computer programming. In this paper we present a numerical equation for mass stopping power of protons in four types of human body substance, i.e. water, bone, muscle and tissue. The equation was obtained by fitting the data values obtained from SRIM program. By using the numerical equation, then the algorithm programming is expected to become simpler and easier.

"A common way to learn is by studying written step-by-step tutorials such as worked examples. However, tutorials for computer programming can be tedious to create since a static text-based format cannot convey what happens as code executes. We created a system called Codepourri that enables people to easily create visual coding tutorials by annotating steps in an automatically-generated program visualization. Using Codepourri, we developed a novel crowdsourcing workflow where learners who are visiting an educational website (www.pythontutor.com) collectively create a tutorial by annotating execution steps in a piece of code and then voting on the best annotations. Since there are far more learners than experts, using learners as a crowd is a potentially more scalable way of creating tutorials. Our experiments with 4 expert judges and 101 learners adding 145 raw annotations to two pieces of textbook Python code show the learner crowd's annotations to be accurate, informative, and containing some insights that even experts missed.

"A combined two-staged analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was proposed with respect to its compatibility in selection of e-textile architecture. Specifically, it was examined in its ability to support decision in determination of appropriate e-textile structures prior to sensor integration. The e-textile structure selection methodology for sensor integration was implemented by interviewing with the experts from the fields of textiles and electronics; hence, it was constructed as two-staged methodology including both experimental study and AHP. In this respect, different e-textile structures including transmission lines containing 15 different conductive yarn types with three different weave types were manufactured via weaving technology in the first stage as experimental part of the methodology, and then, in the second stage, the alternatives based on experimental study were evaluated using AHP. The comparisons were made using priority scales assigned by expert team and synthesized to get aggregated global ratings. In conclusion, appropriate e-textile structures based on weaving manufacturing technology for sensor integration were chosen using AHP technique by ranking alternatives.

"Ageing is the primary risk factor for cognitive deterioration. Given that the cerebral blood flow (CBF) or regulation of cerebral circulation is attenuated in the elderly, it could be expected that ageing-induced cognitive deterioration may be affected by a decrease in CBF as a result of brain ischemia and energy depletion. CBF regulation associated with cerebral metabolism thus likely plays an important role in the preservation of cognitive function. However, in some specific conditions (e.g. during exercise), change in CBF does not synchronize with that of cerebral metabolism. Our recent study demonstrated that cognitive function was more strongly affected by changes in cerebral metabolism than by changes in CBF during exercise. Therefore, it remains unclear how an alteration in CBF or its regulation affects cognitive function. In this review, I summarize current knowledge on previous investigations providing the possibility of an interaction between regulation of CBF or cerebral metabolism and cognitive function.

"Accurate rainfall-runoff modeling during typhoon events is an essential task for natural disaster reduction. In this study, a novel hybrid model which integrates the outputs of physically based hydrologic modeling system into support vector machine is developed to predict hourly runoff discharges in Chishan Creek basin in southern Taiwan. Seven storms (with a total of 1200 data sets) are used for model calibration (training) and validation. Six statistical indices (mean absolute error, root mean square error, correlation coefficient, error of time to peak discharge, error of peak discharge, and coefficient of efficiency) are employed to assess prediction performance. Overall, superiority of the present approach especially for a longer (6-h) lead time prediction is revealed through a systematic comparison among three individual methods (i.e., the physically based hydrologic model, artificial neural network, and support vector machine) as well as their two hybrid combinations. Besides, our analysis and in-depth discussions further clarify the roles of physically based and data-driven components in the proposed framework. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"A crucial operation in the maintenance of data quality in relational databases is to remove tuples that mutually describe the same entity (i.e., duplicate tuples) and to replace them with a tuple that minimizes information loss. A function that combines multiple tuples into one is called a fusion function. In this paper, we investigate fusion functions for attributes of which the values can be sorted by means of an order relation that reflects a notion of generality. It is shown that providing such an order relation a priori, let alone keeping it up-to-date, is a costly operation. Therefore, the Dynamical Order Construction (DOC) algorithm is proposed that constructs an order relation in an automated fashion upon inspecting the data that need to be fused. Such order relations can be immediately deployed in a framework of selectional fusion functions, which are fusion functions that adopt the sort-and-select principle. These fusion functions are investigated closely in terms of their selection strategies. An experimental evaluation of our method shows the influence of the parameters and the benefit with respect to using a fixed and predefined taxonomy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"A promising development in the design of datacenters is the hybrid network architecture consisting of both optical and electrical elements, in which end-to-end traffic can be routed through either an electrical path or an optical path. The core optical switch is used to dynamically create optical paths between pairs of electrical edge-switches in such a datacenter network. In this context, the joint problem of bandwidth allocation and VM-placement poses new and different challenges not addressed yet in hybrid datacenter. In particular, we foresee two issues: (i) the number of edge-switches that can be simultaneously reached using optical paths from an edge-switch is limited by the size of the optical switch, (ii) the dynamic creation of optical paths can potentially establish a constrained optical network topology leading to poor performance. In this work, we abstract the requests of tenants as virtual networks, and study the problem of embedding virtual networks on a hybrid datacenter. We formulate the problem as a non-linear optimization problem and analyze its complexity. We develop and analyse three algorithms for embedding dynamically arriving virtual network demands on a hybrid optical-electrical datacenter. Through simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of not only exploiting the already established optical paths, but also of using electrical network in embedding requests of virtual networks.

"Aim : Major depressive episode (MDE) can manifest with different features. Discriminating between different types of MDEs is crucial for proper treatment. The aim of this study is to propose a new tool for MDE assessment in bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD) to overcome some limitations of current rating scales. The proposed tool investigates all of the clinical features of different MDEs and gives qualitative information, differentiating patients with the same score but different symptoms and psychopathology severity. To achieve this purpose authors used a new methodology called Formal Psychological Assessment (FPA). FPA allows creating relations between the items of an assessment tool, and the set of diagnostic criteria of a given clinical disorder. In the application at hand, given the capability to analyze all clinical features, FPA appears a useful way to highlight and differentiate between inhibited and agitated depressive symptoms. Method : The new tool contains 41 items constructed through 23 clinical criteria from the DSM-5 and literature symptoms. In line with FPA, starting from a set of items and a set of clinical criteria, a Boolean matrix was built assigning to each item its own set of clinical criteria. The participants include 265 in the control group and 38 patients with MDE (diagnosed with MDD or BD) who answered the QuEDS. After 1 month, 63 participants performed the test again and 113 took the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale to analyze convergent-divergent validity. Results : The scale showed adequate reliability and validity. A hierarchical confirmatory factor analysis highlighted the presence of three sub factors (affective, somatic, and cognitive) and one high-order factor (depression). Conclusions : The new tool is potentially able to inform clinicians about the patients' most likely diagnostic configuration. Indeed, the clinical state of a patient consists of the subset of items he/she answered affirmatively, along with his/her subset of specific symptoms. Qualitative information is fundamental from a clinical perspective, allowing for the analysis and treatment of each patient according to his/her symptoms in an effective way.

"A novel approach using microresonating system with low power consumption is proposed for determining Young's modulus of mirco and nano-sized waveguide material. Based on the Mason rule with signal flow graph (SFG) method in the Z-domain, the optical transfer function is derived for resonating layout consists of two single microring resonators which are indirectly coupled to an add-drop micro resonator. A mathematical function is determined for critical coupling coefficient and the optimum optical transmission of proposed system. For the resonant mode numbers of 5;3;3, the free spectral range (FSR) is extended to 182 nm with the out of band rejection ratio(OBRR) of 50 dB and the Q factor is 8593. The Young's modulus is determined based on a change in the sensing ring radius due to the applied external force on the waveguide that causes the wavelength shift in resonant peaks. The Young's modulus for the lateral surface of the SOI waveguide with 250 nm height and 1.5 mu m radius is determined to be 147.72 GPa and for the upper surface of the SOI waveguide with 440 nm average width and 1.5 mu m radius is determined to be 83.93 GPa. The proposed resonating system is a potential candidate for measuring Young's modulus of materials in mirco and nano size with high resolution and has the advantages of the low power consumption due to the low intensity source.

"A spectrum of disease extends beyond the rigid confines of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) encompasses non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) in individuals without established radiographic changes but with other clinical/imaging axSpA features and AS in those with definite sacroiliac joint changes on pelvic X-rays. A broad consensus about the management of nr-axSpA is emerging among clinicians, but the evidence base remains open to question. To explore whether nr-axSpA and AS should be treated similarly, we examined the literature on their prevalence, natural history, disease burden, and treatment. There is strong evidence that nr-axSpA and AS are expressions of the same disease. Approximately 10% of patients with nr-axSpA will develop radiographic disease over 2 years; after >20 years, the figure may exceed 80%. Nr-axSpA patients have lower CRP and less spinal inflammation on MRI than AS patients but similar disease activity, pain, and quality-of-life impairment. Most patients with nr-axSpA manage well with conservative treatment, but a minority has severe disabling symptoms. Anti-TNF therapy has demonstrated similar efficacy and safety in nr-axSpA and AS. Current evidence does not clearly indicate that anti-TNF treatment can inhibit or limit bony progression of AS, the basis of conservative and anti-TNF treatment is control of symptoms and function. For some patients with nr-axSpA, the need for powerful treatments is as great as in some with AS; thus, treatment of axSpA should be consistent across the axSpA spectrum with anti-TNF agents being available, irrespective of radiographic change, according to the same criteria as those applied to AS.

"A 2.5-year-old spayed female American Pit Bull Terrier dog presented with a primary complaint of chronic refractory ascites. The dog's CBC displayed a moderate to severe macrocytic, hypochromic, nonregenerative anemia, and a moderate leukopenia as result of a moderate neutropenia and monocytopenia. Microscopic examination of the blood smear showed marked anisocytosis, mild polychromasia, mild acanthocytosis and ovalocytosis, moderate schistocytosis and poikilocytosis, and 4 metarubricytes/100 WBC. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a homogenous, mild to moderately hyperechoic appearing liver as well as marked amounts of speckled anechoic to slightly hypoechoic peritoneal fluid. Cytology of the ascitic fluid demonstrated a sterile transudate, with evidence of a chronic inflammatory reaction as well as erythroid and myeloid precursor cells, and a few megakaryocytes with occasional micromegakaryocytes. Histologic sections of bone marrow, spleen, and liver were examined, using routine H&E stains, as well as a variety of immunohistochemistry and other special stains. Histopathology of the bone marrow and spleen revealed varying degrees of fibrosis, erythroid, and myeloid hyperplasia, as well as multiple small hyperplastic clusters of megakaryocytes. The megakaryocytes displayed many features of atypia such as increased cytoplasmic basophilia and occasional abnormal chromatin clumping with mitoses. Histopathologic examination of the liver disclosed evidence of mild extramedullary hematopoiesis. This case represents the first report of canine idiopathic myelofibrosis associated with peritoneal extramedullary hematopoiesis, resulting in refractory ascites. Although idiopathic myelofibrosis is a relatively rare condition in dogs, this case demonstrates that ascites caused by peritoneal implants of hematopoietic tissue may be the initial manifestation of myelofibrosis.

"A model of the dynamics of self-regulation describes two patterns of commitment or progress that individuals may follow when selecting goal directed behaviors. In the commitment pattern, individuals are more likely to highlight congruent goal behavior choices while in the progress pattern individuals are more likely to balance between incongruent and congruent goal behavior choices. This study set out to test the model in the context of problematic Internet usage. After being primed about problematic Internet usage, a sample of 97 undergraduate university students completed an online survey rating the value of Internet, academic and social-related behaviors across three conditions. The three conditions paired behaviors so that they appeared to complement each other, appeared to compete against each other, and presented them individually. Results showed that Internet behaviors were rated more highly when presented as complementary than when presented as competing, supporting the prediction that presentation format primes progress and commitment frameworks and leads to higher ratings of incongruent goal behavior in the progress condition. While results did not fully support the model's predictions regarding congruent goal behavior, they were in the predicted direction with small to moderate effect sizes. This study may inform clinical interventions by suggesting that individuals experiencing issues with problematic Internet usage would benefit from framing self-regulatory dilemmas in a competing format.

"Accumulating research indicates that the regular practice of physical exercise is beneficial to the human brain. From the improvement of academic achievement in children to the prevention of Alzheimer's disease in the elderly, exercise appears beneficial across the developmental spectrum. Recent work from animal studies also indicates that a pregnant mother can transfer the benefits of exercise during gestation to her offspring's brain. Exercising pregnant rats give birth to pups that have better memory and spatial learning as well as increased synaptic density. To investigate whether this transfer from the pregnant mother to her child also occurs in humans, we conducted a randomized controlled trial (n=18) and measured the impact of exercise during pregnancy on the neuroelectric response of the neonatal brain with electroencephalography (EEG). Here we show that, compared to the newborns of mothers who were inactive during their pregnancy, the children of exercising pregnant women are born with more mature brains. This was measured with the infant slow positive mismatch response (SPMMR), an electroencephalographic potential known to decrease in amplitude with age. The SPMMR reflects processes associated with brain maturation via its response to sound discrimination and auditory memory. In this study, the children of the mothers who exercised throughout their pregnancy have a smaller SPMMR than the children of mothers who remained sedentary (p=.019). Our results demonstrate the impact regular exercise during pregnancy can have on the development of the human fetal brain.

"A real-time image filtering technique is proposed which could result in faster implementation for fingerprint image enhancement. One major hurdle associated with fingerprint filtering techniques is the expensive nature of their hardware implementations. To circumvent this, a modified anisotropic Gaussian filter is efficiently adopted in hardware by decomposing the filter into two orthogonal Gaussians and an oriented line Gaussian. An architecture is developed for dynamically controlling the orientation of the line Gaussian filter. To further improve the performance of the filter, the input image is homogenized by a local image normalization. In the proposed structure, for a middle-range reconfigurable FPGA, both parallel compute-intensive and real-time demands were achieved. We manage to efficiently speed up the image-processing time and improve the resource utilization of the FPGA.

"A simplified method for the accurate prediction of the natural frequencies of cable-stayed bridges is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method artificial neural network (ANN) is applied to derive a simple formula to predict the natural frequencies of cable-stayed bridges based on existing natural frequency data.

ANN automatically constructs the relationships and adapts based on the training data presented to them. Also, the proposed method takes into account the wide range of parameters which may have a significant effect on the natural frequencies of cable-stayed bridges. The proposed method is particularly useful for the preliminary design stage of cable-stayed bridges where free vibration analysis needs to be carried out. The proposed method is compared with two existing empirical methods. It is found that the simplified method proposed in this study can produce a more accurate prediction of the natural frequencies of cable-stayed bridges than the existing empirical methods.

This modelling tool aims to contribute to urban water planning for smart city development. Plugrisost is a simulation model that facilitates the evaluation of rainwater harvesting (RWH) and greywater systems at different scales of urban planning, It is the only tool known thus far to integrate structural elements such as the sizing of storage tanks, estimated cost and quantitative environmental analysis.

Using Plugrisost, we have found that on the singlehouse scale, the economic viability of an RWH system would be possible if the price of water is greater than 4 Euros/m(3); and the environmental analysis would be favourable to tanks with less than 5 m(3) of storage capacity.

Deviations from these percentages and their impacts on operational capabilities are of particular interest to healthcare planners. In this study, we investigate intelligent ways of admitting patients to a proton therapy facility that maximize the total expected number of treatment sessions (fractions) delivered to patients in a planning period with stochastic patient arrivals and penalize the deviation from the patient mix restrictions. We propose a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model that provides very useful insights in determining the best patient admission policies in the case of an unexpected opening in the facility (i.e., no-shows, appointment cancellations, etc.).

"A novel type of hydraulic structure is proposed for rainwater harvesting in an arid area of Jordan. The project is to develop an irrigation scheme near the Dead Sea, where low annual precipitation and high salinity are the major concerns. The scheme consists of an irrigated farm, a reservoir, and an intake structure to divert ephemeral flood flows into the reservoir. The harvested water is expected to be fresh in comparison with the groundwater in the vulnerable freshwater lens. This research focusses on hydraulic design and actual construction processes of the structure. The structure consists of a gutter cutting across a 16 m wide valley bottom and a conveyance channel of 60 m long to guide the water into the reservoir. The conveyance channel is equipped with a spillway part. As a result of level surveys and hydrological considerations, it was revealed that the structure should have a width of 1.6 m and supercritical flows should be dominant. Details of structure dimensions were designed with numerical and model experiments. A finite volume scheme for the two-dimensional shallow water equations was used to numerically reproduce the whole flow field during a rainwater harvesting event with the maximum design discharge. The numerical scheme employs special fluxsplitting and data reconstruction techniques that realize stable computation of very shallow transcritical flows. A distorted hydraulic model with 1/8 horizontal scale and 1/1 roughness scale was constructed in an experimental station in Japan, in order to test hydraulic phenomena that the numerical method cannot represent. Then, the structure was actually constructed at the site. The channel bottoms are made of reinforced concrete, while the side walls are of concrete blocks whose sizes have been chosen according to the design. However, minor changes were made during the construction processes due to workability constraints. The numerical experiments were conducted again to confirm the actual structure showing desired performance.

Based on phylogenomic analysis, we clustered the six A, caldus strains isolated from various ecological niches into two groups: group 1 strains with smaller genomes and group 2 strains with larger genomes. We found no obvious intraspecific divergence with respect to predicted genes that are related to central metabolism and stress management strategies between these two groups. Although numerous highly homogeneous genes were observed, high genetic diversity was also detected. Preliminary inspection provided a first glimpse of the potential correlation between intraspecific diversity at the genome level and environmental variation, especially geochemical conditions. Evolutionary genetic analyses further showed evidence that the difference in environmental conditions might be a crucial factor to drive the divergent evolution of A, caldus species. We identified a diverse pool of mobile genetic elements including insertion sequences and genomic islands, which suggests a high frequency of genetic exchange in these harsh habitats. Comprehensive analysis revealed that gene gains and losses were both dominant evolutionary forces that directed the genomic diversification of A, caldus species. For instance, horizontal gene transfer and gene duplication events in group 2 strains might contribute to an increase in microbial DNA content and novel functions. Moreover, genomes undergo extensive changes in group 1 strains such as removal of potential non-functional DNA, which results in the formation of compact and streamlined genomes. Taken together, the findings presented herein show highly frequent gene turnover of A. caldus species that inhabit extremely acidic environments, and shed new light on the contribution of gene turnover to the evolutionary adaptation of acidophiles.

"An improved continuum model of three-span suspension bridges has been developed to study the effects of hanger extensibility on free vertical vibrations. This model can be applied to both hinged and continuous girders. To obtain the equations of motion, coupled differential equations describing the vertical deflections of the main cable and the girder are derived with dimensionless parameters. Following the Galerkin method, with shape functions for the main cable and for hinged and continuous girders, equations of motion are obtained in matrix form. A compatibility equation is used to eliminate the additional horizontal force of the main cable in the equations. Natural frequencies of hinged and continuous suspension bridges are evaluated as a function of six dimensionless parameters: the relative elastic bending stiffness of the girder, the relative elastic axial stiffness of the main cable, the relative elastic axial stiffness of the hangers, the relative mass of the girder, the relative length of the side span, and the ratio of the main span sag to the maximum hanger length. Parametric studies are conducted in which each of these parameters is varied individually to observe its effect on the natural frequencies and to identify differences between a conventional model with inextensible hangers and the improved model with extensible hangers. It is found that hanger extensibility affects the natural frequencies and mode shapes of higher modes for suspension bridges with a large relative girder stiffness. This effect is slightly more pronounced for antisymmetric modes and continuous bridges. In addition, even for a bridge with a large relative girder stiffness, the hanger extensibility rarely affects the natural frequencies of higher modes if the bridge either has a large relative mass of the girder or a large relative length of the side span.

"A cross sectional study was conducted in a group of 317 subjects older than 60 in Malaysia, aimed to determine risk factors associated with cognitive impairment in older adults, focusing on trace elements and DNA damage. Cognitive decline was determined by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde-MDA and superoxide dismutase-SOD) were determined and DNA damage was assayed using Alkaline Comet Assay. Toenail samples were taken and analyzed using ICP-MS to determine trace element levels. A total of 62.1 % of subjects had cognitive impairment. Subjects with cognitive impairment had significantly higher levels of MDA and DNA damage as compared to the group with normal cognitive function; MDA (2.07 +/- 0.05 nmol/L vs 1.85 +/- 0.06 nmol/L) (p < 0.05) and DNA damage (% Tail Density, 14.52 +/- 0.32 vs 10.31 +/- 0.42; Tail Moment, 1.79 +/- 0.06 vs 1.28 +/- 0.06) (p < 0.05 for all parameters). However, the level of SOD among subjects with cognitive impairment (6.67 +/- 0.33 u.e/min/mg protein) was lower than the level among those with normal cognitive functions (11.36 +/- 0.65 u.e/min/mg protein) (p < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression revealed the predictors for cognitive impairment among the subjects were DNA damage (Adjusted odd ratio [OR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-1.59), level of trace elements in toenails namely, lead (OR, 2.471; CI, 1.535-3.980) and copper (OR, 1.275; CI, 1.047-1.552) (p < 0.05). High levels of lead and copper can lead to increase in oxidative stress levels and are associated with DNA damage that eventually could be associated with cognitive decline.

"A methodology for optimum sizing of different components (i.e., rotor diameter, electrical generator rating, and battery capacity) of a standalone wind-battery system is proposed in this paper. On the basis of time series simulation of the system performance along with different design constraints, the entire set of feasible design options, also known as the design space, has been identified on a rotor diameter vs. rated power diagram. The design space of a standalone wind-battery system identifies the entire envelope within which a feasible system may be designed. The optimum configuration of the standalone system is identified on the basis of minimum cost of energy (US$/kWh). It is observed that the cost of energy is sensitive to the magnitude of average demand and the wind regime. Sensitivity of the capital cost on the minimum cost of energy is also studied.

"A well-functioning hematopoietic system requires a certain robustness and flexibility to maintain appropriate quantities of functional mature blood cells, such as red blood cells and platelets. This review focuses on the cytokine receptor that plays a significant role in thrombopoiesis: the receptor for thrombopoietin (TPO-R; also known as MPL). Here, we survey the work to date to understand how this receptor functions at a molecular level throughout its lifecycle, from traffic to the cell surface, dimerization and binding cognate cytokine via its extracellular domain, through to its subsequent activation of associated Janus kinases and initiation of downstream signaling pathways, as well as the regulation of these processes. Atomic level resolution structures of TPO-R have remained elusive. The identification of disease-causing mutations in the receptor has, however, offered some insight into structure and function relationships, as has artificial means of receptor activation, through TPO mimetics, transmembrane-targeting receptor agonists, and engineering in dimerization domains. More recently, a novel activation mechanism was identified whereby mutated forms of calreticulin form complexes with TPO-R via its extracellular N-glycosylated domain. Such complexes traffic pathologically in the cell and persistently activate JAK2, downstream signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), and other pathways. This pathologic TPO-R activation is associated with a large fraction of human myeloproliferative neoplasms.

"An Ionic Polymer-Metal Composite (abbr. IPMC) is a type of a smart material consisting of two layers of noble metal and an ion-conducting layer between them. Smart ma- terials are generally capable of actuating and sensing. Mechanical deformation of the IPMC beam produces an electric potential difference (in the order of mV) proportional to the tip displacement on the electrodes. In this paper, the sensing capabilities of IPMC samples will be investigated. The composites are manufactured in a form of a thin (0.3 mm) plate, which are cut into rectangular samples. Tests will be performed on separate samples and two electrically connected samples. Response to various frequencies will be tested for each sample and for two mechanically and electrically coupled samples, creating a simple sensor array.

"A fully autonomous intracranial device is built to continually record neural activities in different parts of the brain, process these sampled signals, decode features that correlate to behaviors and neuropsychiatric states, and use these features to deliver brain stimulation in a closed-loop fashion. In this paper, we describe the sampling and stimulation aspects of such a device. We first describe the signal processing algorithms of two unsupervised spike sorting methods. Next, we describe the LFP time-frequency analysis and feature derivation from the two spike sorting methods. Spike sorting includes a novel approach to constructing a dictionary learning algorithm in a Compressed Sensing (CS) framework. We present a joint prediction scheme to determine the class of neural spikes in the dictionary learning framework; and, the second approach is a modified OSort algorithm which is implemented in a distributed system optimized for power efficiency. Furthermore, sorted spikes and time-frequency analysis of LFP signals can be used to generate derived features (including cross-frequency coupling, spike-field coupling). We then show how these derived features can be used in the design and development of novel decode and closed-loop control algorithms that are optimized to apply deep brain stimulation based on a patient's neuropsychiatric state. For the control algorithm, we define the state vector as representative of a patient's impulsivity, avoidance, inhibition, etc. Controller parameters are optimized to apply stimulation based on the state vector's current state as well as its historical values. The overall algorithm and software design for our implantable neural recording and stimulation system uses an innovative, adaptable, and reprogrammable architecture that enables advancement of the state-of-the-art in closed-loop neural control while also meeting the challenges of system power constraints and concurrent development with ongoing scientific research designed to define brain network connectivity and neural network dynamics that vary at the individual patient level and vary over time.

"A previous bioinformatics analysis identified the Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteins Rv2125 and Rv2714 as orthologs of the eukaryotic proteasome assembly chaperone 2 (PAC2). We set out to investigate whether Rv2125 or Rv2714 can function in proteasome assembly. We solved the crystal structure of Rv2125 at a resolution of 3.0 angstrom, which showed an overall fold similar to that of the PAC2 family proteins that include the archaeal PbaB and the yeast Pba1. However, Rv2125 and Rv2714 formed trimers, whereas PbaB forms tetramers and Pba1 dimerizes with Pba2. We also found that purified Rv2125 and Rv2714 could not bind to M. tuberculosis 20S core particles. Finally, proteomic analysis showed that the levels of known proteasome components and substrate proteins were not affected by disruption of Rv2125 in M. tuberculosis. Our work suggests that Rv2125 does not participate in bacterial proteasome assembly or function. IMPORTANCE Although many bacteria do not encode proteasomes, M. tuberculosis not only uses proteasomes but also has evolved a posttranslational modification system called pupylation to deliver proteins to the proteasome. Proteasomes are essential for M. tuberculosis to cause lethal infections in animals; thus, determining how proteasomes are assembled may help identify new ways to combat tuberculosis. We solved the structure of a predicted proteasome assembly factor, Rv2125, and isolated a genetic Rv2125 mutant of M. tuberculosis. Our structural, biochemical, and genetic studies indicate that Rv2125 and Rv2714 do not function as proteasome assembly chaperones and are unlikely to have roles in proteasome biology in mycobacteria.

Diagnosis requires both the presence of clinical symptoms and low testosterone levels. However, diagnosing andropause in this age group may be challenging since symptoms are frequently non specific and testosterone levels are influenced by a multitude of parameters such as lifestyle factors and chronic diseases. In this article we discuss the pathophysiology, definition and diagnostic difficulties of andropause in geriatric patients. Moreover, we review the relation between testosterone levels and frequent geriatric syndromes such as falls, osteoporosis, cognitive and mood disorders, anemia and cardiovascular disease.

"Adolescence is a key developmental period for preventing substance use initiation, however prevention programs solely providing educational information about the dangers of substance use rarely change adolescent substance use behaviors. Recent research suggests that mind-body practices such as yoga may have beneficial effects on several substance use risk factors, and that these practices may serve as promising interventions for preventing adolescent substance use. The primary aim of the present study was to test the efficacy of yoga for reducing substance use risk factors during early adolescence. Seventh-grade students in a public school were randomly assigned by classroom to receive either a 32-session yoga intervention (n = 117) in place of their regular physical education classes or to continue with physical-education-as-usual (n = 94). Participants (63.2 % female; 53.6 % White) completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires assessing emotional self-regulation, perceived stress, mood impairment, impulsivity, substance use willingness, and actual substance use. Participants also completed questionnaires at 6-months and 1-year post-intervention. Results revealed that participants in the control condition were significantly more willing to try smoking cigarettes immediately post-intervention than participants in the yoga condition. Immediate pre- to post-intervention differences did not emerge for the remaining outcomes. However, long-term follow-up analyses revealed a pattern of delayed effects in which females in the yoga condition, and males in the control condition, demonstrated improvements in emotional self-control. The findings suggest that school-based yoga may have beneficial effects with regard to preventing males' and females' willingness to smoke cigarettes, as well as improving emotional self-control in females. However additional research is required, particularly with regard to the potential long-term effects of mind-body interventions in school settings. The present study contributes to the literature on adolescence by examining school-based yoga as a novel prevention program for substance use risk factors.

"An anomalously slight glacier mass gain during 2000 to the 2010s has recently been reported in the Karakoram region. However, to date, no investigations of the region-wide glacier mass balance in the Karakoram prior to 2000 have been reported, leaving a knowledge gap for assessing glacier responses to climate change. We calculated elevation and mass change using DEMs generated from KH-9 images acquired during 1973-1980 and the 1 arc-second SRTM DEM. We find a slight mass loss of -0.09 +/- 0.03 m w.e. a(-1) (12 366 km(2)) for 1973-2000, which is less negative than the global average rate for 19712009 (-0.31 +/- 0.19 m w.e. a(-1)). Within the Karakoram, the glacier change patterns are spatially and temporally heterogeneous. In particular, a nearly stable state in the central Karakoram (-0.04 +/- 0.05 m w.e. a(-1) during the period 1974-2000) implies that the Karakoram anomaly dates back to the 1970s. Combined with the previous studies, we conclude that the Karakoram glaciers as a whole were in a nearly balanced state during the 1970s to the 2010s.

"A trophic ulcer is a pressure ulcer caused by external trauma to a part of the body that is compromised due to disease, vascular insufficiency, or loss of afferent nerve fibers. Spinal dysraphism (ie, neural tube defects [NTD]) such as meningomyelocele is a risk factor for developing these ulcers in adults and pediatric patients. Information regarding the occurrence of trophic ulcers in pediatric patients with NTD is lacking. A review of the English-language literature on skin/neuropathic ulcers in patients with NTDs, irrespective of study design, published between 1975 and 2014, was undertaken using the PubMed database. Search terms included trophic ulcer, neuropathic ulcer, NTDs, and meningomyelocele. From among the more than 200 papers related to skin care in neonates and pediatric patients, 11 addressed skin ulcers in patients of NTD - 1 in French (a review article), 1 in German (a case report), and 9 in English (7 cohort studies and 2 reviewing surgical techniques). Typically, ulcers in patients with NTD are neuropathic (ie, related to nerve pathology). The most common type is meningomyelocele. Patients with NTD present with a spectrum of functional and sensory deficits that impair mobility; other causative factors that may contribute to the occurrence of ulcers include stress to the tissue, the length of time the stress occurs, muscle spasticity, infection, moisture, and nutritional status of the patient. Awareness of ulcer risk and preventive measures, such as maintaining foot flexibility or careful handling bony prominences such as kyphosis, is important. Once an ulcer occurs, management is challenging and involves collaboration of multiple medical, surgical, nutrition, and other specialists. If an ulcer develops and NTD has not been previously treated surgically or the MRI shows evidence of retethering, surgical treatment is needed. More research is needed to help guide ulcer prevention and treatment strategies in pediatric patients with NTD.

"3D human pose estimation from a single image is an important problem in computer vision with a number of applications, including action recognition and scene understanding. However, it is still challenging due to its ill-posedness and complex non-rigid shape variations of a human body.

Inaccuracies of 2D part detections are handled by selecting from a diverse set of 2D pose candidates considering both the 2D part model and 3D shape model. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs favorably compared with existing methods, despite inaccuracies of 2D part detections and 3D shape ambiguities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Adsorption cooling and Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) systems are promising technologies that can be used to exploit the abundant amount of low grade heat sources such as solar energy, geothermal energy and waste heat from industrial processes. In this study, a two bed adsorption cooling cycle has been integrated with an ORC to simultaneously generate cooling and power utilising AQSOA-ZO2 (SAPO-34)/water and silica-gel/water as adsorption working pairs and R245fa, R365mfc and R141b as ORC working fluids. Four different scenarios of integrated adsorption-ORC system have been investigated, where in the first three scenarios, adsorption system is set up as a topping system, while ORC is set up as a bottoming system. The first one utilized the waste heat of adsorption to power the ORC system with no additional heat and named as Adsorption Heat Recovery Scenario (AHRS). In the second scenario the adsorption return heating fluid is used to power the ORC system (Return Adsorption Heating Fluid Scenario RAHFS). In the third scenario (Heat Exchanger Scenario HES), the cooling and heating sources leaving the adsorption system enter a heat exchanger, where additional heat can be added to the cooling fluid in order to power the ORC system. In the fourth scenario (Return ORC Heating Fluid Scenario RORCHFS), the ORC is considered to be as a topping system, while the adsorption system considered as bottoming system and the return ORC heating fluid can be used to power the adsorption cycle. Results show that when using AHRS, the integrated adsorption-ORC system can achieved system efficiency of 70% using silica-gel/water and R141b and 60% using SAPO-34/water and R141b.

"Alternative materials, like recycling materials, industrial by-products and soils already influenced by human activities (e.g. urban soils) are commonly accepted as building material in earthwork constructions. The risk of contaminant leaching from these materials can be limited by reducing the amount of percolating water. Technical safeguards are means to achieve this, but they must be adapted to the requirements of road construction. The research project aims to better knowledge of the percolation and leaching processes in road embankments constructed from alternative materials with different technical safeguards. The input and behavior of water and contaminants from re-used soils and road runoff is measured in eight field lysimeters at an urban road in an enterprise zone in Augsburg, southern Germany with about 9,700 vehicles per day. Each lysimeter contains the cut out of an embankment. The technical safeguards aim to decrease percolation and include a capillary barrier/drainage layer from geotextile and a second one from gravel, a bituminous film of 1 kg/m(2) and a modified mineral sealing of 10 cm. A sandy gravel and a loamy soil were each used for construction of the embankment cut out in four lysimeters. The soils were spiked with a low contamination of Cd, Cu and CN- to test the efficiency of the technical safeguards. In the percolate water of the lysimeters as well as in the road runoff the pH value, electrical conductivity and the concentrations of sulphate, chloride, As, Pb, CN-, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Mo, Sb, Tl, V and Zn have been analyzed in two-week composite samples since July of 2010. The amount of road runoff, lysimeter runoff and percolating water with its electrical conductivity are measured continuously. It has to be noted that measures were taken during a testing period in order to solve imperfections in the test set-up. These measures will have affected the observations presented. Results show that the unfiltered road runoff shows considerable concentrations of Zn and also elevated concentrations of Pb, as expected from former experience and literature. Up to now, all embankment types lead to a strong retention of these two substances. However, elevated Zn and Pb concentrations can be found in the percolating water during times of high chloride concentrations originating from deicing salt. Furthermore it was shown that the average contaminant leaching of each lysimeter was relatively small during the measurement period. Changes in concentrations of other parameters seem to be induced mainly by high chloride content of the infiltrating road runoff, but the time of occurrence of the changes in the effluent as well as the temporal variations depend also on the soil type, soil pH and the technical safeguards. Additionally, it seems that the soil type has a stronger influence on the percolation process compared to the different technical safeguards. Possible reasons will be discussed.

"A computational method to determine the shielding effectiveness against electromagnetic interference of carbon nanotube (CNTs)-based nanocomposites through modelling of its electrical properties is presented. Specifically, simulations based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) were implemented to evaluate the electrical conductivity (sigma) of CNTs (used as a filler in a polymer matrix) that formed electrical network inside a representative cuboid volume of the sample. A pseudo three-dimensional (3D) percolation model was developed to study the effects of random connectivity of CNTs to one another on the conductivity of nanocomposites. In our approach, both contact and intrinsic resistances were taken into account. The tunneling resistance between CNTs was also taken into account while dealing with single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs). A resistor network recognition method that optimizes connective paths was built using ACO method and conductivity was subsequently computed as a function of CNTs concentration. Then, the shielding effectiveness was computed using the conductivity data. It is remarkable that the calculated SE values as a function of frequency of EM waves at a constant weight percent of CNTs were in agreement with the experimental data for CNT-based nanocomposites reported in literature.

"A Summary The aim of this study is to correlate radiometric indices from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images and bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women. Quantitative CBCT indices can be used to screen for women with low BMD. Purpose Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by the deterioration of bone tissue and the consequent decrease in BMD and increase in bone fragility. Several studies have been performed to assess radiometric indices in panoramic images as low-BMD predictors. The aim of this study is to correlate radiometric indices from CBCT images and BMD in postmenopausal women. Methods Sixty postmenopausal women with indications for dental implants and CBCT evaluation were selected. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was performed, and the patients were divided into normal, osteopenia, and osteoporosis groups, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Cross-sectional images were used to evaluate the computed tomography mandibular index (CTMI), the computed tomography index (inferior) (CTI (I)) and computed tomography index (superior) (CTI (S)). Student's t test was used to compare the differences between the indices of the groups' intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results Statistical analysis showed a high degree of interobserver and intraobserver agreement for all measurements (ICC >0.80). The mean values of CTMI, CTI (S), and CTI (I) were lower in the osteoporosis group than in osteopenia and normal patients (p < 0.05). In comparing normal patients and women with osteopenia, there was no statistically significant difference in the mean value of CTI (I) (p = 0.075). Conclusions Quantitative CBCT indices may help dentists to screen for women with low spinal and femoral bone mineral density so that they can refer postmenopausal women for bone densitometry.

"An advanced particle distribution controlling approach is proposed for laser melt injection process, which applies an electric-magnetic compound field to assist the laser melt injection process. The electric-magnetic synergistic effect on the reinforcement particle distribution in laser melt injection is investigated using numerical and experimental methods. Spherical WC particles are used as the reinforcement and their distribution in the longitudinal sections of the laser melt injection layers is examined with SEM and studied with computer graphics processing. The distributions of fluid temperature, fluid velocity and reinforcement particles in the molten pool are simulated using a 2D multi-physics model coupled with the equations of heat transfer, fluid dynamics, drag force, Lorentz force and phase transition. The results show that, the directional Lorentz force due to an electric-magnetic compound field, as a sort of volume force, can change the equivalent buoyancy acting on the particles. When the Lorentz force and gravity force are in same direction, majority of particles are trapped in the upper region of laser melt injection layer, while when the Lorentz force and gravity force are in opposite direction, most particles are concentrated in the bottom region. As a result, the distribution gradient of WC particles can be controlled by the electric-magnetic compound field, instead of the time-consuming adjustment of process parameters.

"A series of pH/redox dual stimuli-responsive poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine)(25)-block-poly(l-histidine)(n) (p[MPC])(25)-b-p[His](n), n=20, 35, 50, and 75) copolymers consisting of a pH-responsive p(His)(n) block and a biocompatible phospholipid analog p(MPC) block connected by a redox-responsive disulfide linker have been synthesized. The block copolymers are self-assembled into uniform micelles (approximate to 100 nm) in which doxorubicin (Dox) is efficiently encapsulated. The in vitro release profile shows an enhanced release of Dox at low pH (5.0) in 10 mM glutathione (GSH). The in vitro cell viability assays performed using various cell lines show that the blank hybrid micelles have no acute or intrinsic toxicity. A pH-dependent cytotoxicity is observed with the Dox-loaded micelles, especially at pH 5.0. Moreover, confocal microscopy images and flow cytometry results show the pH-dependent cellular uptake of Dox-loaded micelles. Therefore, the Dox-loaded micelles can be considered a good candidate for cancer therapy. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym. Chem. 2017, 55, 2061-2070

"A number of epidemiological studies have established a link between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). So, nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) plays an important role in the treatment of AD. However, current PPAR gamma-targeting drugs such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are associated with undesirable side effects. We identified herbal extract with a small molecular, astragaloside IV (AS-IV), as a selective PPAR gamma natural agonist in nervous cells by developing a PPAR-PPRE pathway regulatory system. Cultured SH-SY5Y cells transfected with pEGFP-N1-BACE1 were treated with AS-IV for 24 h or AS-IV plus the PPAR-gamma antagonist GW9662 in vitro. APP/PS1 mice were intragastrically treated with AS-IV or AS-IV plus the GW9662 every 48 h for 3 months. Immunofluorescence, western blotting, and real-time PCR were used to examine the expression of PPAR gamma and BACE1. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to analyze the distribution of A beta plaques in the APP/PS1 mouse brain. The levels of A beta were determined using ELISA kits. AS-IV was shown to be a PPAR gamma agonist by establishing a high-throughput screening model for PPAR gamma agonists. The results showed that AS-IV treatment increased activity of PPAR gamma and inhibited BACE1 in vitro. As a result, A beta levels decreased significantly. GW9662, which is a PPAR gamma antagonist, significantly blocked the beneficial role of AS-IV. In vivo, AS-IV treatment increased PPAR gamma and BACE1 expression and reduced neuritic plaque formation and A beta levels in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. These effects of AS-IV could be effectively inhibited by GW9662. These results indicate that AS-IV may be a natural PPAR gamma agonist that suppressed activity of BACE1 and ultimately attenuates generation of A beta. Therefore, AS-IV may be a promising agent for modulating A beta-related pathology in AD.

"A prerequisite for simulating the biophysics of complex biological tissues and whole organisms are computational descriptions of biological matter that are flexible and can interface with materials of different viscosities, such as liquid. The landscape of software that is easily available to do such work is limited and lacks essential features necessary for combining elastic matter with simulations of liquids. Here we present an open source software package called Sibernetic, designed for the physical simulation of biomechanical matter (membranes, elastic matter, contractile matter) and environments (liquids, solids and elastic matter with variable physical properties). At its core, Sibernetic is built as an extension to Predictive-Corrective Incompressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (PCISPH). Sibernetic is built on top of OpenCL, making it possible to run simulations on CPUs or GPUs, and has 3D visualization support built on top of OpenGL. Several test examples of the software running and reproducing physical experiments, as well as performance benchmarks, are presented and future directions are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"A digital low dropout regulator (D-LDO) manages to operate at low voltage and scale with process. But, the tradeoff between current efficiency and transient response speed limits its applications. In this work, a coarse-fine-tuning technique with burst-mode operation is employed to advance this trade-off. Once the output voltage under/overshoot is detected, the power MOS array changes with x16 unit size at 500 MHz sampling frequency for a fixed time, comparing with xi size and 50 MHz in steady state. The limit cycle oscillation (LCO) in steady state is reduced by a feed-forward compensation zero with negligible power and area overheads. The proposed D-LDO is simulated in a 65 nm CMOS process, achieving a 60 mV voltage undershoot and 0.36 ps FOM of speed with a 60 mu A quiescent current, and mode-1 LCO in steady state.

"Aim The study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of imaging for measurement of the length of the ileocolic segment affected by Crohn's disease. Method Fifty-four consecutive patients who underwent resection between 2011 and 2014 for ileocolic Crohn's disease were prospectively studied. All had preoperative MR or CT enterography. Two independent radiologists measured the length of the diseased intestinal segment. The measurements were compared with the length of disease assessed on pathology of the non-fixed surgical specimen. Results The median preoperative length of the Crohn's disease segment on imaging was 20.5 (2-73) cm and 20 (3-90) cm, as measured by the two radiologists. Interobserver agreement was substantial (kappa = 0.69) with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.82 (P < 0.001). The median length of the Crohn's disease segment on pathological examination was 16.5 (2-75) cm and was closely correlated with the radiological measurement (r = 0.76, P < 0.001). The length of the Crohn's disease segment on imaging was correct to within 5 cm of the value on pathology. It was correct in 30 (55%) patients and was underestimated and overestimated in 6 (11.1%) and 18 (33.3%). A length of disease of less than 20 cm found on imaging in 26 patients was confirmed in 25 (96%) on pathology, whereas a length of more than 20 cm found on imaging in 28 patients was confirmed in 18 (64%) on pathology. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and overall accuracy of imaging for predicting a length of less than 20 cm were 71%, 95%, 96%, 64% and 79%. Conclusion Imaging accurately identifies the length of the ileocolic segment of Crohn's disease when it is 20 cm or less on pathological examination. In patients with more extensive disease, imaging tends to overestimate the length and should be interpreted with caution.

"Addiction is a pathology that progressively and insidiously undermines one's autonomy-manifested, among other ways, in the experience of a sense of alienation from oneself and others. Therefore, in seeking to overcome addiction, the rehabilitative journey must facilitate the fostering of autonomy. Here, in as much as autonomy is a socially embedded capacity, so must the therapeutic process-within this context, the client-counselor relationship-be grounded in an attentiveness to and facilitation of autonomy's dialogical antecedents. One such means of achieving this is through the counselor attending to and expressing their ""presence,"" in which they are engaged in a ""person-to-person"" therapeutic alliance underpinned by a collaborative dynamic. Here, the healthy interpersonal dyad between client and counselor can provide an environment through which the client may more fully recognize their autonomous resources and exercise such resources in a way that enables them to embark on the rehabilitative journey, and, attendant to this, autonomous living.

"A large set of earthquake records from the highly instrumented Samoa Channel bridge-ground system has been compiled and made available by the California Geological Survey. During six seismic events, more than 30 data channels have been documenting the seismic response of the bridge, abutments, and adjacent ground surface. Of special interest is the response of one of the bridge piers with records at the deck level, pile cap and within the underlying pile foundation. Response of this pile foundation is compared to that of the ground as documented by the nearby Eureka geotechnical downhole array. In this paper, records from the strongest to date 2010 Ferndale earthquake (PGA of about 0.16 g), along with other available low-amplitude events (2007-2014) are employed to evaluate the ground, pile foundation, and overall bridge seismic response. Spatial variation of the recorded motions is examined. Linear and nonlinear response of the ground and the bridge are assessed using system identification techniques. During the strong shaking phase of the 2010 Ferndale Earthquake, a clear and significant stiffness reduction was observed in the column as well as in the foundation of the instrumented pier.

"A fast three-dimensional discrete cosine transform algorithm (3D FCT) and a fast 3D inverse cosine transform (3D IFCT) algorithm are presented, suitable for analysis of 3D data points. Many existing algorithms for three-dimensional data points make use of either the 1D cosine transform or both the 2D and 1D cosine transforms. Existing algorithms based on the 1D discrete cosine transform (DCT) apply the separable 1D transform to the data points in the x, y, and z directions, respectively, while those based on 2D and 1D transforms apply the 2D cosine transform for the x-y planes and then the 1D cosine transform in the z direction. The proposed 3D DCT algorithms handle the 3D data points directly and have been shown to be computationally efficient. They involve a 3D decomposition process where a data volume is recursively decomposed in each dimension until unit data cubes are obtained. The algorithms are presented in the form of a signal flow graph which captures the various computations involved. A complexity analysis along with empirical results is included, demonstrating the performance of the proposed direct 3D DCT algorithms. As 3D FCT and IFCT are symmetric and relatively fast, they can be used in any application requiring a real-time symmetric codec, such as video conferencing, online multiparty video games, and three-dimensional graphics rendering.

"According to the Schema Therapy Model, maladaptive parenting styles interact with a child's unique temperament in the development of early maladaptive schemas (EMSs), which in turn increase one's risk for developing pathology. However, few authors have examined the comprehensive model. The purpose of this study was to assess the indirect effect of perceived parenting styles on depressive symptoms through EMSs. Furthermore, a series of moderated mediation analyses were conducted to examine whether the indirect effect varies as a function of temperament. A total of 403 undergraduate students completed measures of perceived parenting experiences, temperament, EMSs, and depressive symptoms. Results indicated that the schema domains of disconnection/rejection and impaired autonomy mediated the relationship between perceived parenting styles and depressive symptoms. Moderation of the indirect effect was only found in two of the twelve tested models. This study lends partial support to the Schema Therapy model and also offers a new way of looking at the interactive nature of the constructs.

"Arid and semi-arid regions around the world face water scarcity problems due to lack of precipitation and unpredictable rainfall patterns. For thousands of years, rainwater harvesting (RWH) techniques have been applied to cope with water scarcity. Researchers have used many different methodologies for determining suitable sites and techniques for RWH. However, limited attention has been given to the evaluation of RWH structure performance. The aim of this research was to design a scientifically-based, generally applicable methodology to better evaluate the performance of existing RWH techniques in (semi-) arid regions. The methodology integrates engineering, biophysical and socio-economic criteria using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) supported by the Geographic Information System (GIS). Jessour/Tabias are the most traditional RWH techniques in the Oum Zessar watershed in south-eastern Tunisia, which were used to test this evaluation tool. Fifty-eight RWH locations (14 jessr and 44 tabia) in three main sub-catchments of the watershed were assessed and evaluated. Based on the criteria selected, more than 95% of the assessed sites received low or moderate suitability scores, with only two sites receiving high suitability scores. This integrated methodology, which is highly flexible, saves time and costs, is easy to adapt to different regions and can support designers and decision makers aiming to improve the performance of existing and new RWH sites.

"A potential problem for persisting large volume of streaming logs with conventional relational databases is that loading large volume of data logs produced at high rates is not fast enough due to the strong consistency model and high cost of indexing. As a possible alternative, state-of-the-art NoSQL data stores that sacrifice transactional consistency to achieve higher performance and scalability can be utilized. In this paper, we describe the challenges in large scale persisting and analysis of numerical streaming logs. We propose to develop a benchmark comparing relational databases with state-of-the-art NoSQL data stores to persist and analyze numerical logs. The benchmark will investigate to what degree a state-of-the-art NoSQL data store can achieve high performance persisting and large-scale analysis of data logs. The benchmark will serve as basis for investigating query processing and indexing of large-scale numerical logs.

"A simplified method for in-plane buckling analysis of pylons of multi-span suspension bridges was proposed. The analysis model is a pylon with an equivalent spring connected to it at the saddle. The stiffness of the equivalent spring was derived from the relation of the horizontal displacement at the saddle and restoring forces from the cables and was expressed with a simple formula. The stiffness of the deck is considered also in the simplified method. This method is suitable not only for three-pylon suspension bridges but also for the suspension bridge with multiple pylons. The example of the Taizhou Bridge with two span length of 2x1080m and three pylons indicates that the equivalent spring stiffness under different load case is not significant for a large span suspension bridge and the equivalent spring stiffness of mid-pylon is very small comparing with the side pylons, and the buckling problem of mid-pylons will be more important than side pylons for a continuous suspension bridge with multiple pylons.

"Acute stress impairs the hippocampusdependent spatial memory retrieval, and its synaptic mechanisms are associated with hippocampal CA1 long-term depression (LTD) enhancement in the adult rats. Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is recognized as a novel gasotransmitter and has the neural protective roles. However, very little attention has been paid to understanding the effects of H2S on spatial memory retrieval impairment. We observed the protective effects of NaHS (a donor of H2S) against spatial memory retrieval impairment caused by acute stress and its synaptic mechanisms. Our results showed that NaHS abolished spatial memory retrieval impairment and hippocampal CA1 LTD enhancement caused by acute stress, but not by glutamate transporter inhibitor L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic (tPDC), indicating that the activation of glutamate transporters is necessary for exogenous H2S to exert its roles. Moreover, NaHS restored the decreased glutamate uptake in the hippocampal CA1 synaptosomal fraction caused by acute stress. Dithiothreitol (DTT, a disulfide reducing agent) abolished a decrease in the glutamate uptake caused by acute stress, and NaHS eradicated the decreased glutamate uptake caused by 5,5'-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic)acid (DTNB, a thiol oxidizing agent), collectively, revealing that exogenous H2S increases glutamate uptake by reducing disulfide bonds of the glutamate transporters. Additionally, NaHS inhibited the increased expression level of phosphorylated c -Jun -N terminal kinase (JNK) in the hippocampal CA1 region caused by acute stress. The JNK inhibitor SP600125 eliminated spatial memory retrieval impairment, hippocampal CA1 LTD enhancement and the decreased glutamate uptake caused by acute stress, indicating that exogenous H2S exerts these roles by inhibiting the activation of JNK signaling pathway.

"An organic p-n bilayer, comprising of an n-type perylene derivative (PTCBI) and p-type lead phthalocyanine (PbPc), was prepared and examined in terms of photoelectrode in the water phase. The PTCBI/PbPc bilayer functioned as a photoanode, which generated a photocurrent due to the oxidation of reactant (i.e., Fell(CN)(6)(4-)) at the PbPc surface. Furthermore, the organo-bilayer also induced a photocatalytic reaction that originated from the oxidising and reducing powers produced at the PbPc and PTCBI, respectively. Based on the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic studies, it has been noted that the PTCBI/PbPc bilayer can respond to the wide spectrum of solar energy (i.e., 400-1100 nm). However, on using metal free phthalocyanine (H2Pc, p-type) as a reference p-type layer and its application as a photocatalyst material in combination with PTCBI, the generated PTCBI/H2Pc bilayer did not show any photocatalysis particularly under the control irradiation of 700-1200 nm.

"A team consisting of an unknown number of mobile agents, starting from different nodes of an unknown network, possibly at different times, have to meet at the same node. Agents are anonymous (identical), execute the same deterministic algorithm and move in synchronous rounds along links of the network. An initial configuration of agents is called gatherable if there exists a deterministic algorithm (even dedicated to this particular configuration) that achieves meeting of all agents in one node. Which configurations are gatherable and how to gather all of them deterministically by the same algorithm? We give a complete solution of this gathering problem in arbitrary networks. We characterize all gatherable configurations and give two universal deterministic gathering algorithms, i.e., algorithms that gather all gatherable configurations. The first algorithm works under the assumption that a common upper bound on the size of the network is known to all agents. In this case our algorithm guarantees gathering with detection, i.e., the existence of a round for any gatherable configuration, such that all agents are at the same node and all declare that gathering is accomplished. If no upper bound on the size of the network is known, we show that a universal algorithm for gathering with detection does not exist. Hence, for this harder scenario, we construct a second universal gathering algorithm, which guarantees that, for any gatherable configuration, all agents eventually get to one node and stop, although they cannot tell if gathering is over. The time of the first algorithm is polynomial in the upper bound on the size of the network, and the time of the second algorithm is polynomial in the (unknown) size itself. Our results have an important consequence for the leader election problem for anonymous agents in arbitrary graphs. Leader election is a fundamental symmetry breaking problem in distributed computing. Its goal is to assign, in some common round, value 1 (leader) to one of the entities and value 0 (non-leader) to all others. For anonymous agents in graphs, leader election turns out to be equivalent to gathering with detection. Hence, as a by-product, we obtain a complete solution of the leader election problem for anonymous agents in arbitrary graphs.

"Aim of this paper was to assess the clinical effectiveness of a novel ultrasound (US) approach for the estimation of bone fragility. A total of 85 female patients (40-80 years) were recruited and underwent conventional DXA investigations of both lumbar spine and proximal femur, an abdominal US scan of the lumbar spine and the FRAX (R) questionnaire for the calculation of osteoporotic fracture probabilities. Acquired US data were analyzed through an automatic algorithm that calculated the Fragility Score (F. S.), a parameter that estimates skeletal fragility from dedicated spectral and statistical analyses. F.S. showed a good correlation with the most reliable fracture risk predictions obtained by FRAX (R) (r=0.71, p<0.001). Since this correlation level with FRAX (R) outcomes was much better than lumbar BMD one ( vertical bar r vertical bar = 0.43) and very similar to that obtained for femoral neck BMD (vertical bar r vertical bar = 0.72), F.S. has the potential to become a simple and non-ionizing method for bone fragility assessment.

"Accumulation and deposition of amyloid-beta (A beta) in the brain represent an early and perhaps necessary step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A beta accumulation leads to the formation of A beta aggregates, which may directly and indirectly lead to eventual neurodegeneration. While A beta production is accelerated in many familial forms of early-onset AD, increasing evidence indicates that impaired clearance of A beta is more evident in late-onset AD. To uncover the mechanisms underlying impaired A beta clearance in AD, we examined the role of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) in astrocytes. Although LRP1 has been shown to play critical roles in brain A beta metabolism in neurons and vascular mural cells, its role in astrocytes, the most abundant cell type in the brain responsible for maintaining neuronal homeostasis, remains unclear. Here, we show that astrocytic LRP1 plays a critical role in brain A beta clearance. LRP1 knockdown in primary astrocytes resulted in decreased cellular A beta uptake and degradation. In addition, silencing of LRP1 in astrocytes led to downregulation of several major A beta-degrading enzymes, including matrix metalloproteases MMP2, MMP9, and insulin-degrading enzyme. More important, conditional knock-out of the Lrp1 gene in astrocytes in the background of APP/PS1 mice impaired brain A beta clearance, exacerbated A beta accumulation, and accelerated amyloid plaque deposition without affecting its production. Together, our results demonstrate that astrocytic LRP1 plays an important role in A beta metabolism and that restoring LRP1 expression and function in the brain could be an effective strategy to facilitate A beta clearance and counter amyloid pathology in AD.

"(Hybrid) electric vehicles are assumed to play a major role in future mobility concepts. Although sales numbers are increasing, little emphasis has been laid on the recycling of some key components such as power electronics or electric motors. Permanent magnet synchronous motors contain considerable amounts of rare earth elements that cannot be recovered in conventional recycling routes. Although their recycling could have large economic, environmental, and strategic advantages, no industrial recycling for permanent magnets is available in western countries at the moment. Regarding the essential steps, dismantling of electric vehicles as well as the extraction of magnets from the rotors, little has been published before. This paper therefore presents and discusses different recycling approaches for the recycling of NdFeB magnets from (hybrid) electric vehicles. Many results stem from the German research project ""Recycling of components and strategic metals of electric drive motors."".

"A non-destructive methodology was developed to automatically detect and quantify bruise volumes in the equatorial region of apples, using X-ray CT images. Grey level threshold values were calculated to segment bruises in 'Jonagold', 'Joly Red' and 'Kanzi' apple fruit using the multi-level Otsu's threshold method. Comparisons were made between the CT-based bruise volume estimates and bruise volume estimates that were based on destructive measurements in combination with simple geometric assumptions. Visualisation of the bruises in both 2 and 3D showed that bruises, resulting from a pendulum impact with a spherical impactor, can be highly irregularly shaped which implies that the bruise volume estimations based on simple geometric assumptions cannot deliver accurate results.

"1. Magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIg) has been extensively used in treating liver injury which is the common adverse reaction of docetaxel (DOC). Due to the narrow therapeutic window, small changes in pharmacokinetic profiles can alter the toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of DOC significantly. The study aimed to explore the effects of MgIg on the disposition of DOC and the potential mechanism in DOC-induced liver injury. 2. Pharmacokinetics and tissues distribution behaviors showed that there was no significant difference between DOC group (DOCG) and MgIg+DOC group (MDOCG). The mRNA and protein levels of cytochrome P450 3A1 (CYP3A1) in liver, intestine, and kidney were significantly upregulated, and the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was obviously downregulated in MDOCG when compared with DOCG. 3. Immunoglobulin M (IgM), CD8+ were upregulated in DOCG; while in MDOCG, IgM, CD8+ recovered to normal levels and complement C-3; CD4+ were upregulated. 4. MgIg had no significant effects on the disposition of DOC in docetaxel-induced liver injury. Additional, potential drug-drug interaction may happen if MgIg co-administered with antitumor drugs which are the substrates of CYP3A4 or P-gp. Hepatoprotective mechanism of MgIg perhaps was through upregulation of C-3, CD4+ and downregulation of IgM, CD8+.

"A variety of compartment models are used for the quantitative analysis of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data. Traditionally, these models use an iterative fitting (IF) method to find the least squares between the measured and calculated values over time, which may encounter some problems such as the overfitting of model parameters and a lack of reproducibility, especially when handling noisy data or error data. In this paper, a machine learning (ML) based kinetic modeling method is introduced, which can fully utilize a historical reference database to build a moderate kinetic model directly dealing with noisy data but not trying to smooth the noise in the image. Also, due to the database, the presented method is capable of automatically adjusting the models using a multi-thread grid parameter searching technique. Furthermore, a candidate competition concept is proposed to combine the advantages of the ML and IF modeling methods, which could find a balance between fitting to historical data and to the unseen target curve. The machine learning based method provides a robust and reproducible solution that is user-independent for VOI-based and pixel-wise quantitative analysis of dynamic PET data.

"A full-order and single-parameter searching method (F-S method) for analyzing coupled flutter instability of long-span bridges is proposed based on the full-discretized model of structure. Based on the proper approximation of the circular frequency of complex modes, the characteristic equation of the full-order system is expressed as a complex generalized eigenvalue equation that contains only two variables. The equation is used for flutter analysis by solving the complex generalized eigenvalue problem with an efficient simultaneous iteration method directly. Since its computation is reliable and efficient, the application of the proposed method on the flutter problems of long-span bridges is practical. Moreover, the flutter analysis is performed for Jiangyin Yangtze river suspension bridge with 1385 m main span in the completed stage to illustrate the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed method.

"Aim of this work was to assess the role of polymorphisms belonging to genes involved in the regulation of ionic homeostasis in Caucasian patients with Meniere Disease (MD). We recruited 155 patients with definite Meniere Disease and 186 controls (Control Group 1) without a lifetime history of vertigo, overlapping with patients for age and rate of hypertension. We validated the positive results on 413 Caucasian subjects selected from a European general population (Control Group 2). The clinical history for migraine and hypertension was collected; genomic DNA was characterized for a panel of 33 SNPs encoding proteins involved in ionic transport. We found a higher rate of migraineurs in MD subjects compared to Group 1 (46.8 vs 15.5%, p = 0.00005). Four SNPs displayed differences in MD patients compared to Group 1 controls: rs3746951 and rs2838301 in SIK1 gene, rs434082 and rs487119 in SLC8A1; the p values of Chi-squared test for genotype frequencies are 0.009, 0.023, 0.009 and 0.048, respectively. SLC8A1 gene encodes for Na+-Ca++ exchanger, while SIK1 gene encodes for Salt Inducible Kinase 1, an enzyme associated with Na+-K+ ATPase function. The validation with Control Group 2 displayed that only rs3746951 and rs487119 are strongly associated to MD (p = 0.001 and p = 0.0004, respectively). These data support the hypothesis that a genetically induced dysfunction of ionic transport may act as a predisposing factors to develop MD.

"Adult mice with a Leydig cell specific deletion of MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and 2 (Mek1(f/f);Mek2(-/-);Cre(+)) mice display Leydig cell hypoplasia and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. We used radioimmunoassays and quantitative PCR to evaluate the function and expression of the Leydig cell genes involved in the conversion of cholesterol to testosterone (Star, Cyp11a1, Hsd3b6, Cyp17a1 and Hsd17b3), androgen metabolism (Srda1 and Dhrs9), and four transcription factors (Creb1, Nr5a1, Nr4a1 and Nr0b1) that regulate the expression of steroidogenic genes. We show that Star, Hsd3b6, Cyp17a1 and Hsd17b3 are downregulated in Ledyig cells of adult Mek1(f/f):Mek2(-/-);Cre(+) mice whereas Srda1 and Dhrs9 are upregulated and Creb1, Nr5a1, Nr4a1 and Nr0b1 are unchanged or upregulated. Functionally, all the downregulated genes but none of the upregulated genes contribute to the decrease in testosterone synthesis in Leydig cells of adult Mek1(f/f);Mek2(-/-);Cre(+) mice because they produce low testosterone and dihydrotestosterone when stimulated with hCG or when incubated with testosterone precursors such as progesterone or androstenedione.

"Analysis of sunlight or solar potential requires the data for a targeted scene to be authentic and accessible as much as possible. In this regard, the data for a real-world scene acquired by ground-based laser scanners are comprehensive and convenient, thus potentially meeting this requirement. To get an accurate result and offer an automatic solution for sunlight analysis, this paper proposes a solar potential analysis method that is run directly on 3-D ground laser scanning point clouds. Our method simulates natural illumination, sunlight hours, and solar radiation of the targeted scene for a specified period. This method first extracts the region of interest (ROI) to obtain targeted points. Then, we compute solar position as a virtual light source and propose a control method acting on the ROI to constraint deviation from the point light source. Finally, we adopt the generalized hidden point removal algorithm to cast shadow of obstruction on the ROI. Besides, experiments to validate the shading method results are carried out for three different periods. The quantitative results in the Xiamen case evaluated by the Hausdorff distance demonstrate the advantage and feasibility of our proposed method.

"A visible light-active, hematite-based photoelectrode platform for suppressing -amyloid (A) self-assembly in vitro is reported. Upon illumination of a light-emitting diode with an anodic bias, the hematite photoanode generates reactive radical species, such as superoxide ions and hydroxyl radicals, via photoelectrocatalytic process. According to our analyses, the hematite photoanode exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on A aggregation under visible light illumination and anodic bias. We found that hole-derived radicals played a significant role of oxidizing A peptides, which effectively blocked further aggregation. The efficacy of photoelectrocatalytic inhibition on A aggregation was enhanced by introducing cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) as a co-catalyst on the hematite photoanode, which facilitated the separation of electron-hole pairs. We verified that both bare and Co-Pi@hematite photoanodes are biocompatible and effective in reducing A aggregation-induced cytotoxicity.

"Accumulating evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (IncRNAs) are crucial regulators of the Epithelial-Mesenchymal-Transition (EMT). TGF-beta signaling is a major inducer of EMT and can facilitate lung cancer metastasis. However, the role of lncRNAs in this process remains largely unknown. Here, we have identified 291 IncRNAs which were differentially expressed in lung cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Of these, the gene body or vicinity of 19 transcripts were also bound by SMAD3. The expression of LINC01186 was significantly decreased in A549 cells treated with TGF-beta. Furthermore, LINC01186 was stably down-regulated in lung cancer tissues compared with normal tissues in TCGA data sets and another published lung cancer data sets. The bioinformatics analysis suggested that LINC01186 was associated with TGF-beta and might participate in EMT process. Moreover, knocking-down LINC01186 promoted cell migration and invasion, whereas, LINC01186 overexpression prevented cell metastasis. Importantly, LINC01186 expression was regulated by SMAD3. And LINC01186 affected several EMT markers expression. These findings suggest that LINC01186, a mediator of TGF-beta signaling, can play a significant role in the regulation of EMT and lung cancer cell migration and invasion. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

"A new high-accuracy current-mode function generator circuit will be presented, the proposed computational structure being designed for implementing a multitude of circuit functions with many applications in VLSI designs. The realization of the original function generator is based on the utilization of a new third-order approximation function that allows to strongly reduce the approximation error for the implemented functions. The circuit requires a much smaller silicon area comparing to similar previouslys reported circuits. The current-mode operation and the independence of the output current of the function generator on technological parameters and on temperature variations additionally increase the overall circuit accuracy. The simulations confirm the theoretical estimated results, showing an accuracy of the functional squaring core equal with 0.97 %. The new proposed function generator based on the third-order approximation function permits to obtain a wide output dynamic range of 28dB for a maximal error of 1dB, when implementing the exponential function. The proposed function generator is designed for a low-voltage operation, being supplied at V-DD=1V.

"(Objective) In order to increase classification accuracy of tea-category identification (TCI) system, this paper proposed a novel approach. (Method) The proposed methods first extracted 64 color histogram to obtain color information, and 16 wavelet packet entropy to obtain the texture information. With the aim of reducing the 80 features, principal component analysis was harnessed. The reduced features were used as input to generalized eigenvalue proximal support vector machine (GEPSVM). Winner-takes-all (WTA) was used to handle the multiclass problem. Two kernels were tested, linear kernel and Radial basis function (RBF) kernel. Ten repetitions of 10-fold stratified cross validation technique were used to estimate the out-of-sample errors. We named our method as GEPSVM + RBF + WTA and GEPSVM + WTA. (Result) The results showed that PCA reduced the 80 features to merely five with explaining 99.90% of total variance. The recall rate of GEPSVM + RBF + WTA achieved the highest overall recall rate of 97.9%. (Conclusion) This was higher than the result of GEPSVM + WTA and other five state-of-the-art algorithms: back propagation neural network, RBF support vector machine, genetic neural-network, linear discriminant analysis, and fitness-scaling chaotic artificial bee colony artificial neural network.

"A new method for obtaining random bijective S-boxes based on discrete chaotic map is presented. The proposed method uses a discrete chaotic map based on the composition of permutations. The obtained S-boxes have been tested on the number of criteria, such as bijection, nonlinearity, strict avalanche criterion, output bits independence criterion, equiprobable input/output XOR distribution and maximum expected linear probability. The results of performance test show that the S-box presented in this paper has good cryptographic properties. The advantage of the proposed method is the possibility to achieve large key space, which makes it suitable for generation of S-boxes for larger values of n. Also, because this method uses discrete chaotic map based on the composition of permutations which has finite space domain, there is no need for discretization of continuous values of chaotic map, so the process of generation of S-boxes is not affected by approximations of any kind.

"Advances in functional brain imaging have improved the search for potential endophenotypic markers in schizophrenia. Here, we employed independent component analysis (ICA) and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) in resting state fMRI on a sample of 35 schizophrenia patients, 20 first-degree relatives and 35 control subjects. Analysis on ICA-derived networks revealed increased functional connectivity between the left frontoparietal network (FPN) and left temporal and parietal regions in schizophrenia patients (P < 0.001). First-degree relatives shared this hyperconnectivity, in particular in the supramarginal gyrus (SMG; P = 0.008). DCM analysis was employed to further explore underlying effective connectivity. Results showed increased inhibitory connections to the left angular gyrus (AG) in schizophrenia patients from all other nodes of the left FPN ( P < 0.001), and in particular from the left SMG (P - 0.001). Relatives also showed a pattern of increased inhibitory connections to the left AG (P = 0.008). Furthermore, the patient group showed increased excitatory connectivity between the left fusiform gyrus and the left SMG (P = 0.002). This connection was negatively correlated to inhibitory afferents to the left AG (P = 0.005) and to the negative symptom score on the PANSS scale (P = 0.001, r = -0.51).

"A SHAPE-MEMORY ALLOY (SMA) is expected to be applied as intelligent or smart material since it shows the functional characteristics of the shape memory effect and superelasticity. Most SMA elements, with these characteristics, perform cyclic motions. In these cases, the fatigue property of SMA is one of the most important issues in view of evaluating functional characteristics of SMA elements. The fatigue proper ties are complex since they depend on stress, strain, temperature and their hysteresis. If an SMA is implanted with high-energy ions, the thermomechanical properties of the material may change, resulting in long fatigue life. In the present study, the nitrogen ion implantation was applied to modify the surface of a TiNi SMA tape and the influence of implantation treatment on the bending fatigue properties was investigated.

"A long literature in demography has debated the importance of place for health, especially children's health. In this study, we assess whether the importance of dense settlement for infant mortality and child height is moderated by exposure to local sanitation behavior. Is open defecation (i.e., without a toilet or latrine) worse for infant mortality and child height where population density is greater? Is poor sanitation is an important mechanism by which population density influences child health outcomes? We present two complementary analyses using newly assembled data sets, which represent two points in a trade-off between external and internal validity. First, we concentrate on external validity by studying infant mortality and child height in a large, international child-level data set of 172 Demographic and Health Surveys, matched to census population density data for 1,800 subnational regions. Second, we concentrate on internal validity by studying child height in Bangladeshi districts, using a new data set constructed with GIS techniques that allows us to control for fixed effects at a high level of geographic resolution. We find a statistically robust and quantitatively comparable interaction between sanitation and population density with both approaches: open defecation externalities are more important for child health outcomes where people live more closely together.

"According to Israeli law, citizens aged 20-40 are obligated to fulfill military reserve duty in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). Guided by the theory of conservation of resources (COR; Hobfoll, 2001), this study examined the association of resource loss and gain (economic, time, familial, work, and personal resources) with level of reserve combat soldiers' distress and satisfaction with their service following the termination of their reserve duty. The sample consisted of 139 male Israeli citizens, ages 23-40, serving as reserve soldiers in the IDF. Using an Internet-based questionnaire, prior to the start of their reserve duty (Time 1), the respondents completed questionnaires assessing psychological traits, social support, and psychological distress. Following the reserve service period (Time 2), the respondents completed a short inventory of resource loss and gain related to the service, and assessments of psychological distress and satisfaction with the service. The main results showed that resource loss was higher on average than resource gain and was associated positively with distress and negatively with satisfaction with the service, whereas resource gain was positively associated with satisfaction only. The findings are compatible with COR theory and point to areas in which reserve soldiers could be assisted in fulfilling the task of maintaining national security while simultaneously preserving personal well-being.

"A Summary: Families that are at psychosocial risk live under personal and contextual circumstances that hinder their parenting skills. They frequently lack the resources necessary for addressing the challenges of parenting and encounter multiple stressful life events. Social support may help diminish the parenting stress that is experienced from living in a disadvantaged environment by enhancing coping strategies. However, previous research examining the associations between parenting stress and social support among at-risk families has been inconclusive. This study analyzed the psychosocial profile of at-risk Portuguese families, the size and composition of their social support networks and the associations between social support and parenting stress. Participants consisted of 167 parents (80% mothers) who received assistance from Child Protection Services. Measures included the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form, the Arizona Social Support Interview Schedule and a socio-demographic questionnaire. Findings: Parenting stress levels were extremely high, with 44.51% of parents showing clinically significant levels. Emotional support was the type of support that was most closely related to parental distress, namely the network size available for providing emotional support (r=-.27, p=.000) and satisfaction with the emotional support received (r=-.24, p=.006). Applications: The size of the emotional support network was significantly smaller among parents who reported clinically significant levels of parenting stress. Hence, having the opportunity to express feelings and concerns as well as engaging in social interactions during leisure time may serve as protective factors against parental stress in at-risk families. Implications of for the interventions of professionals who work with at-risk families are discussed.

"A new stochastic finite element model calibration framework for estimation of the uncertainty in model parameters and predictions from the measured frequency responses is proposed in this paper. It combines the principles of bootstrapping with the technique of FE model calibration with damping equalization. The challenge for the calibration problem is to find an initial estimate of the parameters that is reasonably close to the global minimum of the deviation between model predictions and measurement data. The idea of model calibration with damping equalization is to formulate the calibration metric as the deviation between the logarithm of the frequency responses of FE model and a test data model found from measurement where the same level of modal damping is imposed on all modes. This formulation gives a smooth metric with a large radius of convergence to the global minimum. In this study, practical suggestions are made to improve the performance of this calibration procedure in dealing with noisy measurements. A dedicated frequency sampling strategy is suggested for measurement of frequency responses in order to improve the estimate of a test data model. The deviation metric at each frequency line is weighted using the signal-to-noise ratio of the measured frequency responses. The solution to the improved calibration procedure with damping equalization is viewed as a starting value for the optimization procedure used for uncertainty quantification. The experimental data is then resampled using the bootstrapping approach and the FE model calibration problem, initiating from the estimated starting value, is solved on each individual resampled dataset to produce uncertainty bounds on the model parameters and predictions. The proposed stochastic model calibration framework is demonstrated on a six degree-of-freedom spring-mass system prior to being applied to a general purpose satellite structure.

"Acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) has been implicated in various pathophysiological conditions including asthma, allergic inflammation and food processing. AMCase is most active at pH 2.0, and its activity gradually decreases to up to pH 8. Here we analyzed chitin degradation by AMCase in weak acidic to neutral conditions by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis established originally for oligosaccharides analysis. We found that specific fragments with slower-than-expected mobility as defined by chitin oligosaccharide markers were generated at pH 5.0 similar to 8.0 as by-products of the reaction. We established an improved method for chitin oligosaccharides suppressing this side reaction by pre-acidification of the fluorophore-labeling reaction mixture. Our improved method specifically detects chitin oligosaccharides and warrants quantification of up to 50 nmol of the material. Using this strategy, we found that AMCase produced dimer of N-acetyl-n-glucosamine (G1cNAc) at strong acidic to neutral condition. Moreover, we found that AMCase generates (GIcNAc)(2) as well as (GIcNAc)(3) under physiological conditions. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Aberrant alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) accumulation has been shown to impair mitochondrial function by reducing mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels are a diverse group of non-selective Ca2+ channels, among which TRPC3 is the only one that is localized in mitochondria and plays a role in maintaining the normal MMP. This raises a possibility that altered TRPC3 expression may play a role in the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by alpha-syn accumulation. To demonstrate this possibility, we first examined the expressions of mitochondrial TRPC3 in the brains of aging monkeys and alpha-syn transgenic and wild-type mice. We showed that alpha-syn levels increased in mitochondria in an age-dependent manner that was positively correlated to an elevation of mitochondrial TRPC3. This correlation was more prominent in the striatum than in the cerebellum, possibly due to the greater age-dependent alpha-syn accumulation in the striatum than in the cerebellum. We then used primary neurons overexpressing alpha-syn to investigate the effect of the alpha-syn-induced elevation of mitochondrial TRPC3 on the MMP and apoptotic cell death. We found that neurons with overexpressed alpha-syn had increased mitochondrial TRPC3 and decreased MMP, which were accompanied by increased number of apoptotic neurons. Suppressing TRPC3 expression partially reversed the reduction of MMP and alleviated the apoptotic cell death, indicating that the mitochondrial TRPC3 may play a role in the mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons with alpha-syn accumulation that may occur in not only the aged brain but also the brain with PD.

"Although multi-label learning can deal with many problems with label ambiguity, it does not fit some real applications well where the overall distribution of the importance of the labels matters. This paper proposes a novel learning paradigm named label distribution learning (LDL) for such kind of applications.

LDL is a more general learning framework which includes both single-label and multi-label learning as its special cases. This paper proposes six working LDL algorithms in three ways: problem transformation, algorithm adaptation, and specialized algorithm design. In order to compare the performance of the LDL algorithms, six representative and diverse evaluation measures are selected via a clustering analysis, and the first batch of label distribution datasets are collected and made publicly available. Experimental results on one artificial and 15 real-world datasets show clear advantages of the specialized algorithms, which indicates the importance of special design for the characteristics of the LDL problem.

"A new method of reliability monitoring of electrical devices based on carbon fibres is presented. Due to the thermo-mechanical stress on electronic circuits a loss of fibre network integrity can take place and potential difference may appear between the edges of broken carbon fibres. This potential difference causes an intensive field-emission from surfaces of these broken carbon fibres and an acceleration of emitted electrons. Due to the acceleration of electrons a microwave emission is generated. A CFRP was used to simulate the behaviour of a carbon based electronic device. The sequence of microwave impulses was detected in a frequency bandwidth from 8 to 12 GHz. The rise time of detected microwave impulses is about of few nanoseconds. This time is in agreement with crack formation time in carbon fibre. The correlation between the change of electrical resistance of composites and microwave impulses by fibres fracture is observed. Thus, the breakdown of current that flows through carbon fibres induces detectable microwave emission. That means that defects in electrical circuits can be wireless detected online.

"A novel microbial fuel cell (MFC) was developed to enhance simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) by employing electrons from the anode. The cathode chamber of the reactor consisted of a membrane aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) which was made of an electroconductivity aerated membrane. The maximum power density of 4.20 +/- 0.12 W m(-3) was obtained at a current density of 4.10 +/- 0.11 A m(-2) (external resistance = 10 Omega). Compared with an open-circuit system, the removal rates of NI4+-N and TN were improved by 9.48 +/- 0.33% and 19.80 +/- 0.84%, respectively, which could be ascribed to the electrochemical denitrification. The anode (chemical oxygen demand, COD) and cathode (NO3-) chambers reached the maximum coulombic efficiencies (CEs) of 40.67 +/- 1.05% and 42.84 +/- 1.14%, respectively. It suggested that the electroconductivity MABR has some advantages in controlling aeration intensity, thus improving SND and CEs. Overall, EAM-MFC could successfully generate electricity from wastewater whilst showing high capacity for removing nitrogen at a low COD/N ratio of 2.8 +/- 0.07 g COD g(-1) N. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"A study of the preferred thinking styles among senior health professionals is reported. A total of 49 medical consultants, 50 senior nurses and 53 health managers from two public teaching hospitals in Adelaide, Australia, were invited via a personal letter to complete a questionnaire comprising measures of thinking style (the Rational Experiential Inventory) and cognitive style (two dimensions of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (R)). Managers reported a higher preference for 'rational' reasoning than nurses, whereas medical consultants reported a lower preference for 'experiential' reasoning than both managers and nurses. Cognitive style was largely homogenous. Although generalisation of the findings may be limited due to small sample sizes and the self-selection of participants, an understanding of the thinking styles of senior health professionals will likely inform the design and evaluation of future change strategies.

"A high-throughput, microfluidic flow cell array (MFCA) system has been modified to enable drug screening against small-volume cell-, and tissue cultures. The MFCA is composed of a 3D channel network that simultaneously flows fluids through forty-eight 830 mu m by 500 mu m flow cells, which physically divide and fluidically seal an existing culture into multiple compartments when docked onto the surface of a cell or tissue culture dish. The modified system provides temperature (37 degrees C) and CO2/pH level controls, while continuously flowing solutions (media or other liquid such as drug suspensions) over the cells/tissues. These assays were enhanced and validated using inverted microscopy and fluorescent staining techniques which also allow real time viability and toxicity assessments. This work presents the results of this new generation in vitro drug testing assay performed using this modified MFCA system. This setup allows the testing of 48 drug combinations on 48 different cell-, tissue specimen at once under flow conditions. All 48 flow cells were utilized to test 5 different concentrations of cisplatin (CDDP). CDDP solutions in various concentrations were continually flowed over cultured human ovarian cancer cells for 48 h. Viability assessments were performed using red-orange calcein and SYTOX (R) Green nucleic acid stains. Cells were imaged at the beginning and end of the experiment (48 h). In order to compare and validate MFCAs suitability as drug screening assay, MTT assays were performed on cells. We found that both, MTT and MFCA assays generated dose-response curves with similar profiles. Innovative advantages of the MFCA system include the ability of handling smaller amounts of solutions compared to conventional and current state of the art drug screening and cell viability/toxicity methods. It also provides the ability to continually deliver fresh solution to the cell samples, while eliminating wastes that are produced. Based on our here reported findings MFCA may have a strong potential of providing a more physiological model than current state of the art static MTT assays.

"A technique is proposed for the design of engineered reflectors consisting of doubly periodic arrays printed on thin grounded dielectric substrates that reflect an incoming wave from a given incoming direction to a predetermined outgoing direction. The proposed technique is based on a combination of Floquet theory for propagation in periodic structures and reflect-array principles. A flat surface designed to reflect a TE polarized wave incident at 45 degrees back in the direction of the impinging signal at 14.7 GHz is employed as an example. By means of full-wave simulations, it is demonstrated that the monostatic RCS of a finite reflector is comparable with the specular RCS of a metallic mirror of the same dimensions. It is further shown that comparably high monostatic RCS values are obtained for angles of incidence in the 30 degrees-60 degrees range, which are frequency dependent and thus open opportunities for target localization. A prototype array is fabricated and experimentally tested for validation. The proposed solution can be used to modify the radar cross section of a target. Other potential applications are also discussed.

"A new device for continuous measurement of fruit or stem growth on the basis of an optoelectronic reflex sensor and a microcontroller board was developed and successfully tested under open field conditions. The principle of the system is based on the detection of alternating narrow white and blacks bars printed on a flexible tape, which is tightened as a loop around the measured object and slides under an infrared reflex sensor in response to the object's radial growth. The design of this new sensor allows continuous, long term measurements without the need of periodic maintenance or physical adjustments of the measurement device. The new system measures changes of fruit or stem perimeter rather than diameter, thus yielding a more relevant information about the growth of objects which are intrinsically not of perfectly circular cross-sectional shape. The described sensor is very lightweight and does not require any mechanical frame or support structure. The tested prototypes had a measurement resolution of 0.5 mm of perimeter, corresponding to a resolution of about 0.16 mm of diameter for a spherical object. The cost of the sensor is very modest, as it consists of only few and inexpensive components. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The new method is suitable for transient analysis of highly oscillatory circuits with widely separated time-scales. In addition, the proposed algorithm is capable of producing high-order numerically stable approximation of the transient response. The use of high-order formulas leads to a significant reduction in the computational time compared to low-order EF methods because it allows taking large steps in time while keeping the same accuracy.

"A neurochemical target at which cannabinoids interact to have global effects on behavior is brain noradrenergic circuitry. Acute and repeated administration of a cannabinoid receptor synthetic agonist is capable of increasing multiple indices of noradrenergic activity. This includes cannabinoid-induced 1) increases in norepinephrine (NE) release in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC); 2) desensitization of cortical alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated effects; 3) activation of c-Fos in brainstem locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic neurons; and 4) increases in anxiety like behaviors. In the present study, we sought to examine adaptations in adrenoceptor expression and function under conditions of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1r) deletion using knockout (KO) mice and compare these to wild type (WT) controls. Electrophysiological analysis of alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated responses in mPFC slices in WT mice showed a clonidine-induced a2-adrenoceptor-mediated increase in mPFC cell excitability coupled with an increase in input resistance. In contrast, CB1r KO mice showed an alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated decrease in mPFC cell excitability. We then examined protein expression levels of alpha 2- and beta 1-adrenoceptor subtypes in the mPFC as well as TH expression in the locus coeruleus (LC) of mice deficient in CB1r. Both alpha 2- and inadrenoceptors exhibited a significant decrease in expression levels in CB1r KO mice when compared to WT in the mPFC, while a significant increase in TH was observed in the LC. To better define whether the same cortical neurons express alpha 2A-adrenoceptor and CB1r in mPFC, we utilized high-resolution immunoelectron microscopy. We localized alpha 2A-adrenoceptors in a knock-in mouse that expressed a hemoagglutinin (HA) tag downstream of the alpha 2A-adrenoceptor promoter. Although the alpha 2A-adrenoceptor was often identifiedpre-synaptically, we observed co-localization of CB1r with alpha 2-adrenoceptors post-synaptically in the same mPFC neurons. Finally, using receptor binding, we confirmed prior results showing that alpha 2A-adrenoceptor is unchanged in mPFC following acute or chronic exposure to the synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist, WIN 55,212-2, but is increased, following chronic treatment followed by a period of abstinence. Taken together, these data provide convergent lines of evidence indicating cannabinoid regulation of the cortical adrenergic system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

"A titanium-based alloy with applications as implantable material was chemically graved through different methods, in order to improve the adhesion of a thin hydroxyapatite (HA) film. The aim of this study is to increase the biocompatibility of a metallic material by deposition of a ceramic material on his surface. The metallic material, known as titanium Grade 5 (Ti6Al4V), was investigated through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, with a SE detector for 2 and 3D images) and an Energy Dispersive X-ray Analyser (EDAX), after chemical attack and after HA deposition. Hydroxyapatite was deposited using electrophoretic equipment, each time using the same experimental conditions, so that a comparison can be made. After deposition, the material was calcined and some mechanical properties were investigated. The experimental results present a homogeneous layer formed with a very good adhesion and dimensionally reduced particles. The metallic material, used as dental implant, presents a better corrosion resistance in simulated body fluid electrolyte and the EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) tests emphasize the formation of two layers, a compact one of TiO2 (titanium oxide) and a porous one of HA on top of the surface.

"A warming climate is anticipated to increase the future heat-related total mortality in urban areas. However, little evidence has been reported for cause-specific mortality or nonurban areas. Here we assessed the impact of climate change on heat-related total and cause-specific mortality in both urban and rural counties of Jiangsu Province, China, in the next five decades. To address the potential uncertainty in projecting future heat-related mortality, we applied localized urban- and nonurban-specific exposure response functions, six population projections including a no population change scenario and five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), and 42 temperature projections from 21 global-scale general circulation models and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Results showed that projected warmer temperatures in 2016-2040 and 2041-2065 will lead to higher heat-related mortality for total non-accidental, cardiovascular, respiratory, stroke, ischemic heart disease (IHD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) causes occurring annually during May to September in Jiangsu Province, China. Nonurban residents in Jiangsu will suffer from more excess heat-related cause-specific mortality in 2016-2065 than urban residents. Variations across climate models and RCPs dominated the uncertainty of heat-related mortality estimation whereas population size change only had limited influence. Our findings suggest that targeted climate change mitigation and adaptation measures should be taken in both urban and nonurban areas of Jiangsu Province. Specific public health interventions should be focused on the leading causes of death (stroke, IHD, and COPD), whose health burden will be amplified by a warming climate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"A critical step in metastases formation is cancer-cell invasion through tissue. During invasion, cells change morphology and apply forces to their surroundings. We have previously shown that single, metastatic breast-cancer cells will mechanically indent a synthetic, impenetrable polyacrylamide gel with physiological-stiffness in attempted invasion; benign breast cells do not indent the gels. In solid tumors, e.g., breast cancers, metastases occur predominantly by collective cell-invasion. Thus, here we evaluate the effects of cell proximity on mechanical invasiveness, specifically through changes in gel indention. Gel indentation is induced by 56, 33 and 2% (in >1000 cells), respectively, of adjacent high metastatic potential (MP), low MP and benign breast cells, being double the amounts observed in single, well-separated cells. Single cells exhibited a distribution of indentation depths below 10 A mu m, while adjacent cells also showed a second peak of deeper indentations. The second peak included 65% of indenting high MP cells as compared to 15% in the low MP cells, illustrating the difference in their invasiveness. Thus, proximity of the metastatic cells enhances their mechanical ability to invade, demonstrating why collective cancer-cell migration is likely more efficient. This could potentially provide a rapid, quantitative approach to identify metastatic cells, and to determine their metastatic potential.

"Aggregation and neurotoxicity of amyloid beta (A beta) protein is a hallmark characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study we compared the anti-aggregatory and neuroprotective effects of five synthetic compounds against A beta protein; four of which possessed a five membered heterocycle ring scaffold (two dibenzyl phenyl imidazolidines and two triazole sulfanyl acetamides) and one with a fused five membered heterocycle (benzoxazole) ring, selected thorough virtual screening from ZINC database. Molecular docking of their optimized structures was used to study A beta binding characteristics. As predicted from molecular docking, strong steric binding of imidazolidines and H-bonding of both triazoles to A beta were translated into anti A beta aggregation properties. Subsequent transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to assess their effects on A beta(1-42) fibril formation. Four compounds variably altered morphology of Ab fibrils from long, intertwined fibrils to short, loose structures. Thioflavin T assay of A beta fibrillisation kinetics demonstrated that one imidazolidine and both triazole compounds inhibited A beta aggregation. Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were exposed to A beta(1-42), alone and in combination with the heterocyclic compounds to assess neuroprotective effects. A beta(1-42)-evoked loss of neuronal cell viability was significantly attenuated in the presence of both imidazolidine compounds, while the triazole acetamides and benzoxazole compound were toxic to PC12 cells. These findings highlight the A beta anti-aggregative and neuroprotective propensity of a dibenzyl phenyl imidazolidine scaffold (Compound 1 and 2). While the triazole sulfanyl acetamide scaffold also possessed A beta anti-aggregation properties, they also demonstrated significant intrinsic neurotoxicity. Overall, the predictive efficacy of in silico methods enables the identification of novel imidazolidines that act both as inhibitors of A beta aggregation and neurotoxicity, and may provide a further platform for the development of novel Alzheimer's diseasemodifying pharmacotherapies.

"A daily black carbon (BC) exposure assessment of forty 10-12 years-old children was conducted in the Seoul Metropolitan Area from August 2015 to January 2016. Each participant carried a microaethalometer to measure BC concentrations for 24 h while their whereabouts and microenvironments (MEs) were recorded via a time-activity diary (TAD) and follow-up interviews. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to compare average BC levels by potential risk factors including demographic, temporal, residential, and indoor/outdoor/transportation activity variables. The children's average daily exposure was 1.93 g/m(3), with a range of 0.2-85.43 g/m(3) (mean daily individual exposure ranges from 0.54 to 4.80 g/m(3)). Even children attending the same elementary school reported BC exposures which differed by approximately 40%, primarily because of individually distinct time-activity patterns and the MEs with which each child interacted. On weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) (1.86 2.50 g/m(3)) and holidays (Saturdays, Sundays, and vacation) (1.71 2.48 g/m(3)), children were subject to reduced exposures to BC, likely due to decreased surrounding traffic volumes and different time-activity patterns on weekend days compared to on weekdays (from Mondays to Fridays) (1.95 2.44 g/m(3)) or school days (weekdays during the school semesters) (2.05 2.43 mu g/m(3)). Commuting in diesel vehicles (often to private academies) or in the subway, cooking, and environmental tobacco smoke were all found to elevate BC exposure. Likewise, proximity to traffic sources and parental indoor smoking contributed to the enhancement of residential BC concentrations. Our findings suggested a need to emplace proactive measures including diesel fleet regulation and smoking cessation campaigns to protect children from high levels of BC exposure.

"A reliable, accurate noninvasive method for identifying patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in the primary care setting is needed. A population-based case-finding instrument may assist managed care organizations in identifying candidates for disease management or quality improvement programs. Our aim was to develop and validate a GERD case-finding instrument. A 12-item ""GERD Screener"" was developed based on literature review and expert opinion with questions about heartburn and regurgitation frequency and severity and medication use, as well demographics and exclusion criteria. Categorical and continuous scoring methods with and without medication use were developed a priori. Using a telephone interview in a medical group, we identified and enrolled 100 subjects with a history of GERD-like symptoms and 103 controls. Each subject completed the GERD Screener, a validated gastrointestinal symptom questionnaire, the Digestive Health Symptom Index (DHSI), and was evaluated independently by two gastroenterologists using a structured format. Agreement by the two physicians that symptoms were consistent with GERD and required an intervention was considered the gold standard. In all, 70 subjects were classified as having GERD and 106 as controls using the gold standard (kappa = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.63-0.82). The scoring method for the screening instrument using a continuous measure of GERD symptoms (frequency and severity) and weighted medication use resulted in an area under ROC of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84-0.94). Using a cutoff of >9 points, this measure was 83% sensitive and 83% specific. Compared to the gold standard, the DHSI GERD subscale has an area under ROC of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84-0.94). The GERD Screener was highly correlated with the DHSI GERD subscale, r = 0.78 (95% CI 0.72-0.83; P < 0.0001). In conclusion, the GERD Screener has demonstrated construct, convergent, and predictive validity. It is shorter than existing validated instruments, practical, and easily administered, which may reduce the response and administrative burden. This may serve as a valuable case-finding instrument in primary-care and managed-care organizations wishing to implement programs to improve the quality and efficiency of care.

"Afferent input from A delta and C-fibres innervating the urinary bladder are processed differently by the brain, and have different roles in signaling bladder sensation. A delta fibres that signal bladder filling activate a spino-bulbo-spinal loop, which relays in the midbrain periaqueductal grey (PAG) and pontine micturition centre (PMC). The excitability of this circuitry is regulated by tonic GABAergic inhibitory processes. In humans and socialised animals micturition is normally under volitional control and influenced by a host of psychosocial factors. Higher nervous decision-making in a social context to 'go now' or 'do not go' probably resides in frontal cortical areas, which act as a central control switch for micturition. Exposure to psychosocial stress can have profoundly disruptive influence on the process and lead to maladaptive changes in the bladder. During sleeping the voiding reflex threshold appears to be reset to a higher level to promote urinary continence. Under physiological conditions C-fibre bladder afferents are normally silent but are activated in inflammatory bladder states and by intense distending pressure. Following prolonged stimulation visceral nociceptors sensitise, leading to a lowered threshold and heightened sensitivity. In addition, sensitization may occur within the central pain processing circuitry, which outlasts the original nociceptive insult. Visceral nociception may also be influenced by genetic and environmental influences. A period of chronic stress can produce increased sensitivity to visceral pain that lasts for months. Adverse early life events can produce even longer lasting epigenetic changes, which increase the individual's susceptibility to developing visceral pain states in adulthood. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Across the reproductive spectrum, obesity is associated with greater risks for adverse health outcomes, including higher rates of infertility, subfertility, early pregnancy loss, fetal deaths and stillbirths, congenital anomalies, and pregnancy complications. The excess reproductive morbidity associated with obesity may increase with longer duration, making the current trends among children and young adults particularly critical in terms of their future reproductive potential. Obese women have a lower chance of pregnancy following in vitro fertilization (IVF), require higher dosages of gonadotropins, and have reduced rates of implantation, clinical intrauterine gestation, and live birth rates and increased rates of pregnancy loss, as well as greater risks for prematurity and preeclampsia even when stratified by plurality. Racial and ethnic differences by overweight and obesity in IVF outcomes have been reported. Compared with normal-weight women, failure to achieve a clinical intrauterine gestation is significantly more likely among obese women overall, normal-weight and obese Asian women, normal-weight Hispanic women, and overweight and obese Black women. Among women who do conceive, compared with normal-weight women, failure to achieve a live birth is significantly more likely among overweight and obese women overall, and among overweight and obese Asian women, overweight and obese Hispanic women, and normal-weight and obese Black women. Although weight loss should theoretically be the first line of therapy for obese women, other lifestyle factors, such as regular physical exercise, elimination of tobacco use and alcohol consumption, and stress management, may be of more immediate benefit in achieving conception.

"A single-stage AC-AC converter has been designed for a wind energy conversion system (WECS) that eliminates multistage operation and DC-link filter elements, thus resolving size, weight, and reliability issues. A simple switching strategy is used to control the switches that changes the variable-frequency AC output of an electrical generator to a constant-frequency supply to feed into a distributed electrical load/grid. In addition, a modified random sinusoidal pulse width modulation (RSPWM) technique has been developed for the designed converter to make the overall system more efficient by increasing generating power capacity and reducing the effects of inter-harmonics and sub-harmonics generated in the WECS. The technique uses carrier and reference waves of variable switching frequency to calculate the firing angles of the switches of the converter so that the three-phase output voltage of the converter is very close to a sine wave with reduced THD. A comparison of the performance of the proposed RSPWM technique with the conventional SPWM demonstrated that the power generated by a turbine in the proposed approximately increased by 5% to 10% and THD reduces by 40% both in voltage and current with respect to conventional SPWM.

"A new large dynamic-range variable gain amplifier (VGA) with improved dB linearity is presented. The traditional cascade VGA has the disadvantages of gain mismatch between sub-stages and difficulty of employing mismatch cancelation or suppression algorithms. In this paper, switch arrays were used to make the sub-stages or called gain cells in the coarse-tuning stage (CTS) work independently and therefore prevent the integral operation of the gain errors. Then, a second-order mismatch-shaping DEM was applied conveniently to the CTS and shown to be a useful design technique in improving the dB-linearity performance. The cascade VGA and its second-order mismatch-shaping DEM had been integrated in a 2.4-GHz receiver chip which was fabricated in a 0.18-mu m CMOS technology with a supply voltage of 1.8V. Measurement results showed that the gain errors were significantly reduced with second-order mismatch-shaping DEM with respect to the traditionally thermometric decoding over a temperature range of [-40, 80] degrees C.

"Addressing the global challenges to water security requires a better understanding of humanity's use of water, especially the agricultural sector that accounts for 70% of global withdrawals. This study combined high resolution-data with a GIS system to analyze the impact of agricultural practices, crop type, and spatial factors such as drainage basins, climate, and soil type on the Water Footprint (WF) of agricultural crops. The area of the study, the northern Lower Jordan Valley, covers 1121 ha in which three main plantation crops are grown: banana (cultivated in open-fields or net-houses), avocado and palm-dates. High-resolution data sources included GIS layers of the cultivated crops and a drainage pipe-system installed in the study area; meteorological data (2000-2013); and crop parameters (yield and irrigation recommendations). First, the study compared the WF of the different crops on the basis of yield and energy produced as well as a comparison to global values and local irrigation recommendations. The results showed that net-house banana has the lowest WF based on all different criteria. However, while palm dates showed the highest WF for the yield criteria, it had the second lowest WF for energy produced, emphasizing the importance of using multiple parameters for low and high yield crop comparisons. Next, the regional WF of each drainage basin in the study area was calculated, demonstrating the strong influence of the Gray WF, an indication of the amount of freshwater required for pollution assimilation. Finally, the benefits of integrating GIS and WF were demonstrated by computing the effect of adopting net house cultivation throughout the area of study with a result a reduction of 1.3 MOM irrigation water per year. Integrating the WF methodology and local high-resolution data using GIS can therefore promote and help quantify the benefits of adopting site appropriate crops and agricultural practices that lower the WF by increasing yield, reducing water consumption, and minimizing negative environmental impacts.

"A Non-Technical Loss (NTL) fraud occurs when a fraudster tampers with a smart meter so that the meter registers less electricity consumption than the actual consumed amount, and therefore the utility becomes the victim who suffers the corresponding economic loss. In the literature, many detection schemes have been proposed to detect NTL frauds. However, some NTL frauds are far more complicated than what the existing schemes expect. We recently discovered a new potential type of frauds, a variant of NTL frauds, called Colluded Non-Technical Loss (CNTL) frauds in the Smart Grid. In a CNTL fraud, multiple fraudsters can co-exist or collaborate to commit the fraud. Existing detection schemes cannot detect CNTL frauds since these methods do not consider the co-existing or collaborating fraudsters, and therefore cannot distinguish one from many fraudsters. In this paper, we propose a CNTL fraud detector to detect CNTL frauds. The proposed method can quickly detect a tampered meter based on recursive least squares. After identifying the tampered meter, the proposed scheme can detect different fraudsters using mathematical models. Our experiments show that our method is effective in detecting CNTL frauds.

"Amino acids present a great potential for heavy metals sorption, thanks to their active chemical groups. Tyrosine is an amino acid containing amine, carboxylate and phenol groups and thus is a potential candidate for heavy metals remediation. However, this biomolecule is water soluble, and so it is difficult to remove tyrosine-metal complexes from the water. A potential solution would consist in grafting this biomolecule onto a material to ensure a good separation between heavy metals, trapped by tyrosine-grafted-material, and the water medium. Thus, the grafting of tyrosine onto a polypropylene (PP) nonwoven was carried out. Evidence of the grafting of tyrosine was given by several characterization techniques: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A 3.2% tyrosine grafting rate was obtained. Then, the sorption efficiency of the tyrosine-functionalized material was evaluated by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. At 20 degrees C and for pH 4.5, approximately 48 mg of copper per gram of PP were trapped, confirming the good efficiency of tyrosine. The most interesting result of this study is the constant sorption capacity whatever the sodium chloride concentration in the copper sulfate solution. This result, specific to tyrosine, allows considering the possibility of the use of such material for marine wastewaters and sediments depollution.

"As a primary disposal mean of municipal solid waste in China, the landfill has been recognized as one of the major threats to the surrounding surface water and groundwater environment due to the emission of leachate. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of leachate on the surface water and groundwater environment of the region of the Chang'an landfill, which is located in Sichuan province, China. The surface water and groundwater were sampled for hydrochemical analysis. Three electrical resistivity tomography profiles were conducted to evaluate the impact of leachate on the groundwater environment, and several laboratory tests were carried out to build the relationship between the soil bulk resistivity and the void fluid resistivity. The results showed that a seasonal creek named Longfeng creek, which crosses the landfill site, was contaminated by the leachate. The concentrations of COD, BOD5, and chlorides (Cl) of surface water samples increased by 12.3-105.7 times. The groundwater quality in the surface loose sediments along the valley deteriorated obviously from the landfill to 500 m downstream area. The laboratory tests of soil samples indicated that the resistivity value of 13 Omega m is a critical value whether the groundwater in the loose sediments is polluted. The groundwater at the site adjacent to the spillway in the landfill was partially contaminated by the emission of leachate. The groundwater contamination zones at 580 m downstream of the landfill were recognized at the shallow zones from 60 m left bank to 30 m right bank of Longfeng creek. The improved understanding of groundwater contamination around the landfill is beneficial for the landfill operation and groundwater environment remediation.

"A hall sensor based simple technique was introduced to measure wheel slip and a microcontroller based embedded digital system was developed to display wheel slip data and warn the operator with audible and visible warnings if the optimum range is exceeds. Hall sensor slip measurement system was validated in controlled soil bin condition, tar macadam surface and actual field condition and compared with the commercial radar sensor. The developed system is simple in construction and can be mounted to any make and model of agricultural tractors by entering the appropriate rolling radius via the computer interface.

"Alternating flows in the ground have a detrimental effect on the internal stability of the ground at the bottom of bodies of water, at offshore structures, coastal protection structures, and revetments. A test apparatus for alternating flow was constructed for the purpose of investigating various problems relating to alternating flow in the ground. It was used to conduct investigations into the stability of granular filters for offshore wind turbines subjected to high levels of alternating hydraulic loads. The design criteria for granular filters subjected to oscillating loads must be considerably more stringent than those for granular filters subjected to unidirectional flow. It was also possible to demonstrate that the hydraulic loads due to waves have a significant effect on the filter stability in the area relevant for offshore structures.

"A high-speed folded-cascode OP amplifier with a dynamic switching bias circuit, which enables low power consumption, high gain stably, and a relatively wide dynamic range in low power supply voltages, is proposed. Through simulations, it was shown that the OP amplifier is able to operate at a 10 MHz dynamic switching rate and a dissipated power of 71 % of that observed in continuous operation. It also showed an open loop gain of 51 dB and a 0.996 V output dynamic range which is wider than that in a telescopic OP amplifier. The 10 MHz high-speed switching operation, allowing processing video signals, was confirmed by applying to a switched capacitor non-inverting amplifier with a gain of below 2. The simulation results showed that the output inaccuracy for a switched capacitor amplifier with a gain of below 2 is below 1.5 %, which is practicable. This inaccuracy was caused by the static nonlinearity of the OP amplifier, determined on its limited open loop gain.

"As construction projects become larger and more diversified, various factors such as time, cost, quality, environment, and safety that need to be considered make it very difficult to make the final decision. This study was conducted to develop an integrated Multi-Objective Optimization (iMOO) model that provides the optimal solution set based on the concept of the Pareto front, through the following six steps: (1) problem statement; (2) definition of the optimization objectives; (3) establishment of the data structure; (4) standardization of the optimization objectives; (5) definition of the fitness function; and (6) introduction of the genetic algorithm. To evaluate the robustness and reliability of the proposed iMOO model, a case study on the construction time-cost trade-off problem was analyzed in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. The results of this study can be used: (1) to assess more than two optimization objectives, such as the initial investment cost, operation and maintenance cost, and CO2 emission trading cost; (2) to take advantage of the weights as the real meanings; (3) to evaluate the four types of fitness functions; and (4) to expand into other areas such as the indoor air quality, materials, and energy use.

"A dynamic particle swarm optimization with learning strategy (DPSO-LS) is proposed for key parameter estimation for permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs), where the voltage-source inverter (VSI) nonlinearities are taken into account in the parameter estimation model and can be estimated simultaneously with other machine parameters. In the DPSO-LS algorithm, a novel movement modification equation with variable exploration vector is designed to effectively update particles, enabling swarms to cover large areas of search space with large probability and thus the global search ability is enhanced. Moreover, a Gaussian-distribution-based dynamic opposition-based learning strategy is developed to help the pBest jump out local optima. The proposed DPSO-LS can significantly enhance the estimator model accuracy and dynamic performance. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to multiple parameter estimation including the VSI nonlinearities of a PMSM. The performance of DPSO-LS is compared with several existing PSO algorithms, and the comparison results show that the proposed parameters estimation method has better performance in tracking the variation of machine parameters effectively and estimating the VSI nonlinearities under different operation conditions.

"A multiphysics-based co-simulation technique is developed based on the finite element method for the characterization of 3-D high-frequency integrated circuits (ICs) with integrated microchannel cooling. The multiphysics in the cosimulation includes full-wave electromagnetic, fluid, and transient conjugate heat transfer analyses. For incompressible and fully developed flows, the governing equations of fluid flow are decoupled from temperature, and the velocity field is obtained analytically. The full-wave electromagnetic and the transient conjugate heat transfer analyses are coupled through temperature-dependent material properties. The efficiency of the co-simulation is enhanced through an adaptive time-stepping scheme, a domain decomposition scheme called the finite element tearing and interconnecting (FETI), and FETI-enabled parallel computing. The capability and the efficiency of the proposed co-simulation in analyzing practical and large-scale 3-D ICs are demonstrated through numerical examples. The effectiveness of heat removal through integrated microchannel cooling and the thermal impact on high-frequency characteristics of 3-D IC designs are also demonstrated.

"A new methodology to determine the safety of suspension bridge main cables is proposed in this paper and illustrated by simulating the failure of a corrosion-deteriorated cable composed of 9,061 wires. The approach is the first to use a finite-element (FE) model to predict the failure load, account for load recovery due to friction in broken wires, and simulate the reduced strength of the cable as a three-dimensional random field. To obtain cable failure load, the load is increased gradually, causing individual wires break according to their residual strength variability. Because of the load transfer to surrounding wires, the breakage of an individual wire affects the stress state of its surrounding wires. Consequently, as the load is increased, this local damage spreads to its immediate vicinity, and eventually the entire cable fails. Because of the complexity of the problem, the critical failure load is determined through a Monte Carlo simulation approach that accounts for the uncertainty in the spatial variability of the residual strength of the individual wires. The probability distribution of the load that will drive a suspension bridge cable to failure is reported and investigated in the paper. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

"Agricultural water scarcity is a major limiting factor for crop production in dry land regions of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Despite notable efforts of developing macro-catchment rainwater harvesting (RWH) techniques, few studies have evaluated the performance of RWH for deficit supplemental irrigation of crops. We examine the agro-meteorological risks such as late onset, early cessation, overall low rainfall amounts and long dry spells during the growing season and evaluate the potential of macro-catchment RWH for supplemental irrigation of onion in the southern dry lands of Ethiopia. Field experiments were undertaken during 2012 and 2013 to evaluate the effects of 50% ETc, 75% ETc and 100% ETc irrigation levels on yield and water productivity of onion during dry and wet seasons. The harvestable yield and water productivity of onion under 75% ETc irrigation were not significantly lower than that under 100% ETc irrigation during both the dry and wet seasons. Thus, deficit supplemental irrigation of onion at 75% ETc can be implemented with macro-catchment RWH to reduce the risks of crop failure and significant yield declines in dryland areas.

"A wide variety of large-scale data have been produced in bioinformatics. In response, the need for efficient handling of biomedical big data has been partly met by parallel computing. However, the time demand of many bioinformatics programs still remains high for large-scale practical uses because of factors that hinder acceleration by parallelization. Recently, new generations of storage devices have emerged, such as NAND flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs), and with the renewed interest in near-data processing, they are increasingly becoming acceleration methods that can accompany parallel processing. In certain cases, a simple drop-in replacement of hard disk drives by SSDs results in dramatic speedup. Despite the various advantages and continuous cost reduction of SSDs, there has been little review of SSD-based profiling and performance exploration of important but time-consuming bioinformatics programs. For an informative review, we perform in-depth profiling and analysis of 23 key bioinformatics programs using multiple types of devices. Based on the insight we obtain from this research, we further discuss issues related to design and optimize bioinformatics algorithms and pipelines to fully exploit SSDs. The programs we profile cover traditional and emerging areas of importance, such as alignment, assembly, mapping, expression analysis, variant calling and metagenomics. We explain how acceleration by parallelization can be combined with SSDs for improved performance and also how using SSDs can expedite important bioinformatics pipelines, such as variant calling by the Genome Analysis Toolkit and transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing. We hope that this review can provide useful directions and tips to accompany future bioinformatics algorithm design procedures that properly consider new generations of powerful storage devices.

"A major cause of fatal construction accidents is falls from height (FFH). In this study, the Human Factor Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) was adopted and modified to assist in classifying the root causes of fatal FFH accidents in Hong Kong. The characteristics and root causes of the accidents were analyzed using frequency analysis. The associations among the causes were examined using Fisher's exact test and latent class analysis (LCA). The cases apparently share some common characteristics and certain HFACS factors are closely associated. According to LCA results, the factors in all the cases may be placed into four classes, named as ill planning, violation, hidden hazards created by others, and incapable staffing. Recommendations are made to reduce FFH construction accidents based on the characteristics and root causes. The paper contributes to the body of knowledge in construction management by developing a modified HFACS framework for extracting structured information from construction accident reports, finding the general characteristics and managerial causes behind the FFH accidents, and using LCA to identify the connections among the managerial causes.

"A robust sparse least-mean mixture-norm (LMMN) algorithm is proposed, and its performance is appraised in the context of estimating a broadband multi-path wireless channel. The proposed algorithm is implemented via integrating a correntropy-induced metric (CIM) penalty into the conventional LMMN algorithm to modify the basic cost function, which is denoted as the CIM-based LMMN (CIM-LMMN) algorithm. The proposed CIM-LMMN algorithm is derived in detail within the kernel framework. The updating equation of CIM-LMMN can provide a zero attractor to attract the non-dominant channel coefficients to zeros, and it also gives a tradeoff between the sparsity and the estimation misalignment. Moreover, the channel estimation behavior is investigated over a broadband sparse multi-path wireless channel, and the simulation results are compared with the least mean square/fourth (LMS/F), least mean square (LMS), least mean fourth (LMF) and the recently-developed sparse channel estimation algorithms. The channel estimation performance obtained from the designated sparse channel estimation demonstrates that the CIM-LMMN algorithm outperforms the recently-developed sparse LMMN algorithms and the relevant sparse channel estimation algorithms. From the results, we can see that our CIM-LMMN algorithm is robust and is superior to these mentioned algorithms in terms of both the convergence speed rate and the channel estimation misalignment for estimating a sparse channel.

"A brain network comprising the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and amygdala plays important roles in developmentally regulated cognitive and emotional processes. However, very little is known about the maturation of mPFC-amygdala circuitry. We conducted anatomical tracing of mPFC projections and optogenetic interrogation of their synaptic connections with neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) at neonatal to adult developmental stages in mice. Results indicate that mPFC-BLA projections exhibit delayed emergence relative to other mPFC pathways and establish synaptic transmission with BLA excitatory and inhibitory neurons in late infancy, events that coincide with a massive increase in overall synaptic drive. During subsequent adolescence, mPFC-BLA circuits are further modified by excitatory synaptic strengthening as well as a transient surge in feedforward inhibition. The latter was correlated with increased spontaneous inhibitory currents in excitatory neurons, suggesting that mPFC-BLAcircuit maturation culminates in a period of exuberant GABAergic transmission. These findings establish a time course for the onset and refinement of mPFC-BLA transmission and point to potential sensitive periods in the development of this critical network.

"A new hysteresis window method is proposed as a solution for avoiding the operational dead zone that exists at the transition between buck and boost operating modes in all noninverting buck-boost converters. In addition, this method also eliminates the discontinuities in the converter's steady-state output voltage transfer characteristic, which is a function of the duty cycle. The converter's output voltage function is surjective and, therefore, smooth mode transitions are achieved. The negative effects of operating within the dead zone are shown by the presence of subharmonics in the output voltage, increased output voltage ripple, poor regulation, and the instability of the converter during the transition between buck and boost operating modes. The dead-zone avoidance technique proposed in this paper eliminates all these issues while at the same time ensures highly efficient operation of the converter. An additional advantage of the technique is its simplicity, which allows for implementation into low-cost digital signal controllers, as well as into analog control circuits. The advantageous features of the proposed approach were evaluated on the basis of comparisons with three other dead-zone avoidance approaches and the initial case, which does not utilize any dead-zone avoidance technique. All the experiments were carried out on a purpose-built prototype of a noninverting buck-boost converter with magnetically coupled inductors.

A new entropy-based measure, named the centred error entropy (CEE) index, which is a weighted combination of the error cross-correntropy (ECC) criterion and the error entropy criterion (EEC), is proposed to tune the NN-PID controller.

This NN cascade control approach is applied to superheated steam temperature control of a simulated power plant system, from which the effectiveness and strength of the proposed strategy are discussed by comparison with NN-PID controllers tuned with EEC and ECC criterions.

To reveal the significant importance and smart-material functionality of the energetic-energetic co-crystals, the stability, mechanical and explosive properties TNT/CL-20 co-crystal, TNT crystal and CL-20 crystal were studied. Non-hydrogen bonded non-covalent interactions govern the structures of energetic-energetic co-crystals. However, it is very difficult to accurately calculate the non-covalent intermolecular interaction energies. In this paper, the local conformation and the intricate non-covalent interactions were effectively mapped and analyzed from the electron density (rho) and its derivatives. The results show that the two components TNT and CL-20 are connected mainly by nitro-aromatic interactions, and nitro-nitro interactions. The steric interactions in TNT/CL-20 could not be confronted with the attractive interactions. Moreover, the scatter graph of TNT crystal reveals the reason why TNT is brittle. The detailed electrostatic potential analysis predicted that the detonation velocities (D) and impact sensitivity for the compounds both increase in the sequence of CL-20 >TNT/CL-20 co-crystal >TNT. Additionally, TNT/CL-20 co-crystal has better malleability than its pure components.

Basically, assigning a threshold to each fuzzy set does it. As a result, the proposed approach selects the best feasible sizes solutions to guarantee and to enhance the performances of the ICs in analog signal processing applications.

"A previous study has demonstrated that Danshui River has almost the highest dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) yield in the world and exports most of the DIN in the form of ammonium unlike the world's large rivers. However, the DIN sources are poorly constrained. In this study, the contributions of major sources in the Taipei metropolitan area to the DIN export in the Danshui River were investigated. It is observed that ammonium is the major DIN species in the downstream reaches, resulting from the ammonium-dominated inputs of the effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and rain water pumping stations (RWPS). DIN concentrations in the downstream (urban) reaches are substantially elevated. The upstream tributaries annually discharge similar to 2709 t DIN to the downstream reaches. However, the DIN discharge off the downstream reaches rises to similar to 17,918 t, resulting from the contribution of RWPS-collected water, i.e., similar to 14,632 t, and the effluents of two WWTP, i.e., similar to 577 t. RWPS-collected water inherently contains the contribution of atmospheric deposition, similar to 2937 t DIN. This finding implies that similar to 11,695 t (similar to 66 % of the downstream output) DIN flux off the Danshui River is from urban runoff and can be attributed to human activities in the Taipei metropolitan area. To improve the water quality in the Danshui River, water quality controls in urban runoff are important.

"A trie is one of the data structures for keyword search algorithms and is utilized in natural language processing, reserved words search for compilers and so on. The double-array and LOUDS are efficient representation methods for the trie. The double-array provides fast traversal at time complexity of O(1), but the space usage of the double-array is larger than that of LOUDS. LOUDS is a succinct data structure with bit-string, and its space usage is extremely compact. However, its traversal speed is not so fast. This paper presents a new compression method of the double-array with keeping the retrieval speed. Our new method compresses the double-array by dividing the double-array into blocks and by using linear functions. Experimental results for varied keywords show that our new method reduced space usage of the double-array up to about 44 %, and the retrieval speed of the new method was 9-14 times faster than that of LOUDS. Moreover, the results show that the construction speed of the new method was faster than that of the conventional method for a large keyword set.

"A parallel matheuristic algorithm is presented as a spin-off from the exact Branch-and-Fix Coordination (BFC) algorithm for solving multistage stochastic mixed 0-1 problems. Some steps to guarantee the solution's optimality are relaxed in the BFC algorithm, such that an incomplete backward branching scheme is considered for solving large sized problems. Additionally, a new branching criterion is considered, based on dynamically-guided and stage-wise ordering schemes, such that fewer Twin Node Families are expected to be visited during the execution of the so-called H-DBFC algorithm. The inner parallelization IH-DBFC of the new approach, allows to solve in parallel scenario clusters MIP submodels at different steps of the algorithm. The outer parallel version, OH-DBFC, considers independent paths and allows iterative incumbent solution values exchanges to obtain tighter bounds of the solution value of the original problem. A broad computational experience is reported for assessing the quality of the matheuristic solution for large sized instances. The instances dimensions that are considered are up to two orders of magnitude larger than in some other works that we are aware of. The optimality gap of the H-DBFC solution value versus the one obtained by a state-of-the-art MIP solver is very small, if any. The new approach frequently outperforms it in terms of solution's quality and computing time. A comparison with our Stochastic Dynamic Programming algorithm is also reported. The use of parallel computing provides, on one hand, a perspective for solving very large sized instances and, on the other hand, an expected large reduction in elapsed time. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Al Jabal Al Akhdar, an arid mountain region in northern Oman, has experienced rapid development over the last decades, resulting in the deterioration of water resources. This paper applies the driving force-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework as an integrated environmental assessment tool to illustrate the cause-and-effect relationships for sustainable management of water resources in the area. The research aimed to examine social and ecological aspects of mountain water to explore optimal approaches for sustainable use and management. The water resources are affected by increasing drivers of population growth and socio-economic development, through agriculture, tourism, and urbanization, exerting pressures through overconsumption of water, coupled with the exogenous pressure of climate change. The decreased rainfall and increased water demand have resulted in the degradation of water quantity and quality. The declining state of the water resources and reduced area of cultivation have resulted in considerable losses in agricultural income. The Omani government has adopted some responses, including water development projects, acting to reduce pressures as well as to improve the state of water resources. The DPSIR analysis indicates that trade-offs should be made between economic development and the continued supply of water for the agro-ecological system; choices could be in the prioritization of drivers. A dependence on desalinated water will introduce a reliance on a non-renewable external energy supply and is unlikely to ensure water supply at the multi-century timescale of the social-ecological system. In addition, tourism is predominantly based around the disappearing agro-ecosystems which in turn are dependent on the supply of water. Therefore, efforts should be directed towards improving water-use efficiency through installing modern irrigation technology, water conservation methods, use of greywater and treated wastewater, and rainwater harvesting as well as integrated water resources management, and climate change mitigation and adaptation measures.

"A damage detection methodology is proposed by integrating a nonlinear recursive filter and a non-contact computer vision based algorithm to measure structural dynamic responses. A phase-based optical flow algorithm inspired by the motion magnification technique is used to measure structural displacements, and the unscented Kalman filter is used to predict structural properties such as stiffness and damping coefficients. This non-contact displacement measurement methodology does not require an intensive instrumentation process, does not add any additional mass to the structure which may skew measurements, and can measure more signals compared to traditional methods. This measurement methodology still needs improvement as a tool due to its higher noise level relative to traditional accelerometer and laser vibrometer measurements. In order to detect structural damage using measured displacements from video, an unscented Kalman filter is used to remove noise from the displacement measurement and simultaneously detect damage by identifying the current stiffness and damping coefficient values, given a known mass, which are used to detect damage. To validate the proposed damage detection method state-space equations are derived without external excitation input and experimental tests are carried out. The experimental results show reasonable and accurate predictions of the stiffness and damping properties compared to dynamic analysis calculations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Accurate scale estimation and occlusion handling is a challenging problem in visual tracking. Recently, correlation filter-based trackers have shown impressive results in terms of accuracy, robustness, and speed. However, the model is not robust to scale variation and occlusion. In this paper, we address the problems associated with scale variation and occlusion by employing a scale space filter and multi-block scheme based on a kernelized correlation filter (KCF) tracker. Furthermore, we develop a more robust algorithm using an appearance update model that approximates the change of state of occlusion and deformation. In particular, an adaptive update scheme is presented to make each process robust. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperformed 29 state-of-the-art trackers on 100 challenging sequences. Specifically, the results obtained with the proposed scheme were improved by 8% and 18% compared to those of the KCF tracker for 49 occlusion and 64 scale variation sequences, respectively. Therefore, the proposed tracker can be a robust and useful tool for object tracking when occlusion and scale variation are involved.

"Analysts prototyping trading strategies often reuse previously computed values: both full problems and subproblems. Avoiding recomputing these would increase productivity. We built a memoization library that caches function computations to files to avoid recomputation. This should minimize the need for users to think about whether caching is appropriate while giving them control over speed, accuracy, and space usage. Guo and Engler built an automatic memoization library by modifying the Python interpreter, while jug and joblib are distributed computing libraries that do memoization. Our library attempts to maintain the ease of use of these libraries while offering a higher degree of control of how caching is carried out. It allows control of space usage for individual functions and all memoization, refreshing memoization for a specific function, and accuracy checking, and uses faster hashing and provides a divide and conquer approach to reuse previously computed subproblems. We show that for Markowitz optimization, Fama-French, and the singular value decomposition, memoization using our library greatly speeds up recomputation, often by over 99% versus no memoization and over 80% versus joblib. We also show how a divide-and-conquer memoization approach can give large speedups for sorting. Published 2015. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.

Secondly by programming in Matlab 6.5 (a language for technical computing), VC6.0 ++ and VTK (Visualization ToolKit), and adopting these techniques such as laser scanning, computer graphics, and computer database, a 3D digitized model of the denture has been reconstructed; And then the 3D coordinate data of mark points are measured.

"Apache Hadoop is a widely used distributed computing framework and its file system is Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), which assumes that DataNodes in a system are homogeneous in nature. When a cloud system scales up, DataNodes are very likely to become heterogeneous. Thus, extensive research has been placed on improving performance for heterogeneous Hadoop systems, but little attention has been placed on security improvements. This motivates us to investigate a data allocation scheme called the Secure HDFS (SecHDFS) by integrating the secret sharing technique to improve storage security in a heterogeneous Hadoop system. DataNodes in a Hadoop system are classified into a variety of different types of groups based on their vulnerability characteristics. SecHDFS addresses the increased risk issue caused by data replication in HDFS by allocating fragments of a file to as many different types of DataNodes as possible and multiple replicas of the same fragment to DataNodes of the same type. A storage assurance model is developed to evaluate the quality of security offered by SecHDFS. Analysis of the assurance model and performance evaluation experiments show that SecHDFS does not impact the performance of the Hadoop system that much in comparison with the default HDFS, while significantly improving data assurance in a heterogeneous environment.

The group delay profile of the complementary stub is smooth and continuous while at the same time maintaining a flat magnitude response over an ultra-wide bandwidth. Several units can be cascaded to obtain a desired group delay profile. This configuration can be used in analog signal processing or to reduce the signal distortion from other wideband components.

"Anomaly detection in a large area using hyperspectral imaging is an important application in real-time remote sensing. Anomaly detectors based on subspace models are suitable for such an anomaly and usually assume the main background subspace and its dimensions are known. These detectors can detect the anomaly for a range of values of the dimension of the subspace. The objective of this paper is to develop an anomaly detector that extends this range of values by assuming main background subspace with an unknown user-specified dimension and by imposing covariance of error to be a diagonal matrix. A pixel from the image is modeled as the sum of a linear combination of the unknown main background subspace and an unknown error. By having more unknown quantities, there are more degrees of freedom to find a better way to fit data to the model. By having a diagonal matrix for the covariance of the error, the error components become uncorrelated. The coefficients of the linear combination are unknown, but are solved by using a maximum likelihood estimation. Experimental results using real hyperspectral images show that the anomaly detector can detect the anomaly for a significantly larger range of values for the dimension of the subspace than conventional anomaly detectors.

"Ambient intelligence (Aml) worlds consist of heterogeneous collections of interconnected devices that integrate smoothly in the environment to offer services to their users. These devices can be added, change or fail, modifying the system topology. Also, other circumstances may change, affecting users' activities, e.g., time, location, or the presence of other users. These changes modify the information the system has available to satisfy users' needs, i.e., the context. Aml systems need to adapt to these evolving conditions in order to be able to provide their services, but being as unobtrusive as possible for their users. There are also performance requirements that the system must fulfill to provide responses to environment stimuli in real time. Opportunistic control mechanisms address these issues by monitoring the context, and suspending or resolving goals when the appropriate conditions are met. This paper presents FAERIE, a software framework that supports the development of Aml applications with facilities for context management that rely on opportunistic control.

"Analysis of multitemporal remote sensing imagery offers a reliable and cost-effective means for monitoring crops on a broad-scale and provides consistent temporal measurements. Fractal geometry has been used as a quantitative description of spatial complexity of remote sensing images. Yet, corn field of spatial irregularity alters the fractal dimension of the landscape, which shall be suppressed in the estimation. In this paper, we propose a method for computing fractal dimension from irregular region of interests that minimizes the contribution from 2-D spatial irregularity. Our method was evaluated with normalized difference vegetation index products derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer and satellite pour l'observation de la terre VEGETATION sensors from three states in the U.S. The experimental results using the time series demonstrated that our proposed fractal dimension estimation method exhibited great consistency and invariance to the change of image spectral characteristics, spatial resolution, and the degree of pixel mixing. In contrast to entropy and variance, the spectral characteristics of different imaging devices exhibited lower impact to the fractal dimension, which also implies its scale invariance. With respect to the detection rate of the first peak, fractal dimension achieved the best consistency. The proposed method for computing fractal dimension provides a critical and reliable measure for studying phenological patterns.

"A series of neurological and psychiatric symptoms occur after traumatic brain injury (TBI), with cognitive dysfunction being one of the most prominent sequela. Given that tau hyperphosphorylation is an important cause of cognitive impairment in patients of Alzheimer's disease, our present study detected the presence of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), mainly at Ser404, in multiple brain regions, including the ipsilateral parietal cortex, contralateral hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, immediately after the injury in a mouse TBI model; these changes lasted for at least 4w. All of these brain regions play important roles in working memory. Hyperphosphorylated tau protein was primarily located in neurons and was accompanied by axonal injury and dendritic spine degeneration. Our study demonstrated that p-tau spreads gradually and selectively from the injured cortex to other brain regions after TBI and that all of the affected regions are part of the working memory circuit. These findings provide experimental support for the role of p-tau in cognitive impairment in the early phase after TBI. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"A heuristic procedure based on novel recursive formulation of sinusoid (RFS) and on regression with predictive least-squares (LS) enables to decompose both uniformly and nonuniformly sampled 1-d signals into a sparse set of sinusoids (SSS). An optimal SSS is found by Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) optimization of RFS parameters of near-optimal sinusoids combined with common criteria for the estimation of the number of sinusoids embedded in noise. The procedure estimates both the cardinality and the parameters of SSS. The proposed algorithm enables to identify the RFS parameters of a sinusoid from a data sequence containing only a fraction of its cycle. In extreme cases when the frequency of a sinusoid approaches zero the algorithm is able to detect a linear trend in data. Also, an irregular sampling pattern enables the algorithm to correctly reconstruct the under-sampled sinusoid. Parsimonious nature of the obtaining models opens the possibilities of using the proposed method in machine learning and in expert and intelligent systems needing analysis and simple representation of 1-d signals. The properties of the proposed algorithm are evaluated on examples of irregularly sampled artificial signals in noise and are compared with high accuracy frequency estimation algorithms based on linear prediction (LP) approach, particularly with respect to Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB).

Variance estimates are used to mix the outputs of the sub-filters, imparting variable gain and phase characteristics that permit it to automatically adapt to signal parameter changes.

In open-loop estimation problems, variable gain/bandwidth allows it to reduce the impact of random errors caused by sensor noise and the impact of bias errors caused by model mismatch during ` maneuvers'. In feedback control problems, variable phase/delay allows it to act as a lag filter for an improved steady-state response (i.e. greater noise attenuation) and act as a lead filter, or a proportionalderivative controller, for an improved transient response (i.e. increased closed-loop damping) for input discontinuities.

"According to dichromatic reflection model, the previous methods of specular reflection separation in image processing often separate specular reflection from a single image using patch-based priors. Due to lack of global information, these methods often cannot completely separate the specular component of an image and are incline to degrade image textures. In this paper, we derive a global color-lines constraint from dichromatic reflection model to effectively recover specular and diffuse reflection. Our key observation is from that each image pixel lies along a color line in normalized RGB space and the different color lines representing distinct diffuse chromaticities intersect at one point, namely, the illumination chromaticity. For pixels along the same color line, they spread over the entire image and their distances to the illumination chromaticity reflect the amount of specular reflection components. With global (non-local) information from these color lines, our method can effectively separate specular and diffuse reflection components in a pixelwise way for a single image, and it is suitable for real-time applications. Our experimental results on synthetic and real images show that our method performs better than the state-of-the-art methods to separate specular reflection.

"Ambient Assisted Working (AAW) is a discipline aiming to provide comfort and safety in the workplace through customization and technology. Workers' comfort may be compromised in many labor situations, including those depending on environmental conditions, like extremely hot weather conduces to heat stress. Occupational heat stress (OHS) happens when a worker is in an uninterrupted physical activity and in a hot environment. OHS can produce strain on the body, which leads to discomfort and eventually to heat illness and even death. Related ISO standards contain methods to estimate OHS and to ensure the safety and health of workers, but they are subjective, impersonal, performed a posteriori and even invasive. This paper focuses on the design and development of real-time personalized monitoring for a more effective and objective estimation of OHS, taking into account the individual user profile, fusing data from environmental and unobtrusive body sensors. Formulas employed in this work were taken from different domains and joined in the method that we propose. It is based on calculations that enable continuous surveillance of physical activity performance in a comfortable and healthy manner. In this proposal, we found that OHS can be estimated by satisfying the following criteria: objective, personalized, in situ, in real time, just in time and in an unobtrusive way. This enables timely notice for workers to make decisions based on objective information to control OHS.

Human responses to thermal environments and air quality created by different cooling modes were also studied. Totally 229 completed questionnaires were statistically analysed. The results show that most of the respondents prefer to use air conditioner 3-6 months in a year with relatively low temperature settings especially for respondents living below fifth floor. It is better to choose relatively high temperature settings to reduce air conditioning intensity especially for elders and outdoor workers, which can not only avoid cold thermal discomfort but also reduce electric energy use. For elders, outdoor workers and persons living in higher floor levels, there was an increase usage of electrical fans or natural ventilation. Thermal comfort can be maintained by raised air movement and the perceived air quality could improve obviously by introducing outdoor air, which would create a good sleep environment to ensure sleep quality.

"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and its relative APOBEC3 cytidine deam-inases boost immune response by mutating immune or viral genes. Because of their genome-mutating activities, AID/APOBECs are also drivers of tumorigenesis. Due to highly charged surfaces, extensive non-specific protein-protein/nucleic acid interactions, formation of polydisperse oligomers, and general insolubility, structure elucidation of these proteins by X-ray crystallography and NMR has been challenging. Hence, almost all available AID/APOBEC structures are of mutated and/or truncated versions. In 2015, we reported a functional structure for AID using a combined computational-biochemical approach. In so doing, we described a new regulatory mechanism that is a first for human DNA/RNA-editing enzymes. This mechanism involves dynamic closure of the catalytic pocket. Subsequent X-ray and NMR studies confirmed our discovery by showing that other APOBEC3s also close their catalytic pockets. Here, we highlight catalytic pocket closure as an emerging and important regulatory mechanism of AID/APOBEC3s. We focus on three sub-topics: first, we propose that variable pocket closure rates across AID/APOBEC3s underlie differential activity in immunity and cancer and review supporting evidence. Second, we discuss dynamic pocket closure as an ever-present internal regulator, in contrast to other proposed regulatory mechanisms that involve extrinsic binding partners. Third, we compare the merits of classical approaches of X-ray and NMR, with that of emerging computational-biochemical approaches, for structural elucidation specifically for AID/APOBEC3s.

"A constant-gm, rail-to-rail operational amplifier circuit topology is presented in this paper. The amplifier input stage is realized using single NMOS pair at 0.13 mu m bulk-CMOS process technology. The overall gain variation is within the range of +/- 2.338% for the rail-to-rail common mode input range. The proposed design is able to reject the common mode input response with 115dB of common mode rejection ratio (CMRR). High slew rate is achieved and the simulated value is +19/-43 (V/mu s) of an unity gain buffer op-amp at 5pF of CL. The variation in overall gm and gain are also simulated at different corner temperatures. The circuit simulation is done in Tanner EDA at 1.8V of power supply which dissipates the power of 6.1mW.

"AIM To evaluate the risks of medical conditions, evaluate gastric sleeve narrowing, and assess hydrostatic balloon dilatation to treat dysphagia after vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG). METHODS VSG is being performed more frequently worldwide as a treatment for medically-complicated obesity, and dysphagia is common post-operatively. We hypothesize that post-operative dysphagia is related to underlying medical conditions or narrowing of the gastric sleeve. This is a retrospective, single institution study of consecutive patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy from 2013 to 2015. Patients with previous bariatric procedures were excluded. Narrowing of a gastric sleeve includes: inability to pass a 9.6 mm gastroscope due to stenosis or sharp angulation or spiral hindering its passage. RESULTS Of 400 consecutive patients, 352 are included; the prevalence of dysphagia is 22.7%; 33 patients (9.3%) have narrowing of the sleeve with 25 (7.1%) having sharp angulation or a spiral while 8 (2.3%) have a stenosis. All 33 patients underwent balloon dilatation of the gastric sleeve and dysphagia resolved in 13 patients (39%); 10 patients (30%) noted resolution of dysphagia after two additional dilatations. In a multivariate model, medical conditions associated with post-operative dysphagia include diabetes mellitus, symptoms of esophageal reflux, a low whole blood thiamine level, hypothyroidism, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and use of opioids. CONCLUSION Narrowing of the gastric sleeve and gastric sleeve stenosis are common after VSG. Endoscopic balloon dilatations of the gastric sleeve resolves dysphagia in 69% of patients.

"A bubble pump is proposed to replace the traditional mechanical solution pump in lithium bromide absorption chillers, for its advantageous feature that can be driven by industrial waste heat or solar energy or other low-grade energy. In two-stage bubble pump driven lithium bromide absorption refrigeration system, flow patterns in lifting pipe have significant effects on the performance of bubble pump. In this paper, the single bubble motion and the double bubbles coalescence in vertical ascending pipe are simulated by an improved free energy model of lattice Boltzmann method, in which the two-phase liquid to gas density ratio is 2778. The details of bubbles coalescence process are studied. Density and velocity of bubbles have been obtained. The computational results show that the initial radius of each bubble has a great influence on the coalescence time. The larger the initial bubble radius, the shorter the coalescence time. The pipe diameter has a little effect on the two bubbles coalescence time while it has a significant effect on the bubble velocity. As the pipe diameter increases, the bubble velocity increases. The obtained results are helpful for studying the transition mechanisms of two-phase flow patterns and useful for improving the bubble pump performance by controlling the flow patterns in lifting pipe.

"After decades of independent morphological and functional brain research, a key point in neuroscience nowadays is to understand the combined relationships between the structure of the brain and its components and their dynamics on multiple scales, ranging from circuits of neurons at micro or mesoscale to brain regions at macroscale. With such a goal in mind, there is a vast amount of research focusing on modeling and simulating activity within neuronal structures, and these simulations generate large and complex datasets which have to be analyzed in order to gain the desired insight. In such context, this paper presents ViSimpl, which integrates a set of visualization and interaction tools that provide a semantic view of brain data with the aim of improving its analysis procedures. ViSimpl provides 3D particle-based rendering that allows visualizing simulation data with their associated spatial and temporal information, enhancing the knowledge extraction process. It also provides abstract representations of the time-varying magnitudes supporting different data aggregation and disaggregation operations and giving also focus and context clues. In addition, ViSimpl tools provide synchronized playback control of the simulation being analyzed. Finally, ViSimpl allows performing selection and filtering operations relying on an application called NeuroScheme. All these views are loosely coupled and can be used independently, but they can also work together as linked views, both in centralized and distributed computing environments, enhancing the data exploration and analysis procedures.

To assess its performance a study was carried out on ten mathematical and three truss optimization problems. The results are compared to those obtained using twelve state-of-the-art optimization algorithms and confirm its good and robust performance. A sensitivity analysis and an evaluation of its performance under parallel computing were conducted. The proposed algorithm has only a few tuning parameters, is intuitive, and multi-faceted, allowing application to complex n-dimensional design optimization problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"A numerically robust approach to steady-state calibration of nonlinear dynamic models is presented. The approach is based on explicit formulation of the constraints on validity of internal model signals by set of inequalities. The constrained optimization with feasible iterates guarantees that the model will never be evaluated with invalid internal signals. This overcomes numerical difficulties often encountered when dealing with highly nonlinear models. Because the approach uses a large number of slack variables, distributed least squares algorithm is proposed. The robustness of this approach is demonstrated on a steady-state calibration of turbocharged diesel engine model starting from grossly inaccurate initial estimates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"A novel frequency compensation technique, named Regular Miller plus Reversed Indirect Compensation (RMRIC), is presented in this paper for fast-settling three-stage amplifiers. The RMRIC topology includes, on the one hand, a Miller capacitor combined with one nulling resistor connected between the first stage and the third stage, and on the other hand, an indirect compensation capacitor in series with a resistor added between the first and the second stage, which improves remarkably the performance such as gain-bandwidth product (GBW) and sensitivity of the proposed amplifier. Detailed design considerations are carried out to demonstrate the stability of the compensation technique. Circuit simulation results show the amplifier driving a 2-pF load capacitance achieves a 9.25-GHz GBW dissipating only 16.5 mW with a 1.2 V supply voltage using a TSMC 65 nm CMOS technology, which shows a significant improvement in figure of merits.

"Adaptive deep brain stimulation uses feedback about the state of neural circuits to control stimulation rather than delivering fixed stimulation all the time, as currently performed. In patients with Parkinson's disease, elevations in beta activity (13-35 Hz) in the subthalamic nucleus have been demonstrated to correlate with clinical impairment and have provided the basis for feedback control in trials of adaptive deep brain stimulation. These pilot studies have suggested that adaptive deep brain stimulation may potentially be more effective, efficient and selective than conventional deep brain stimulation, implying mechanistic differences between the two approaches. Here we test the hypothesis that such differences arise through differential effects on the temporal dynamics of beta activity. The latter is not constantly increased in Parkinson's disease, but comes in bursts of different durations and amplitudes. We demonstrate that the amplitude of beta activity in the subthalamic nucleus increases in proportion to burst duration, consistent with progressively increasing synchronization. Effective adaptive deep brain stimulation truncated long beta bursts shifting the distribution of burst duration away from long duration with large amplitude towards short duration, lower amplitude bursts. Critically, bursts with shorter duration are negatively and bursts with longer duration positively correlated with the motor impairment off stimulation. Conventional deep brain stimulation did not change the distribution of burst durations. Although both adaptive and conventional deep brain stimulation suppressed mean beta activity amplitude compared to the unstimulated state, this was achieved by a selective effect on burst duration during adaptive deep brain stimulation, whereas conventional deep brain stimulation globally suppressed beta activity. We posit that the relatively selective effect of adaptive deep brain stimulation provides a rationale for why this approach could be more efficacious than conventional continuous deep brain stimulation in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, and helps inform how adaptive deep brain stimulation might best be delivered.

According to the Jordanian green building code, a classification for the green building has been carried out according to its saving in energy and water in addition to the other factors such as indoor quality and material. The heating and cooling loads were calculated and the results were compared with the values for the same building after amendments to the windows and walls. The insulation for external walls of the building has been introduced in addition the double glazing instead of the current single glass windows for the building. The electricity for the lighting consumption of this building was obtained and analyzed and the potential of utilizing a lighting sensor for different halls and rooms was studied and analyzed. The boiler performance has been studied and an estimation of efficiency enhancement was proposed. It has been found that choosing a larger window area facing south, east and west can save more energy in winter and decreasing the heating costs using a certain types of double glazing, while decreasing the glazing area facing north can save money and energy. Also, it has been found that the payback period for the annual saving in fuel and electricity bills is less than 3 years. The needed investment for obtaining the energy saving is shown in the paper.

"A well-established approach to developing new imaging agents and treatments for cancer begins with the recognition of receptors that are overexpressed in cancer cells. Ideally, these same receptors would also be absent, or minimally expressed, in healthy tissue. The mu (mu) and delta (delta) opioid receptors (MOR and DOR respectively) match these criteria, with expression in cancer cells that is higher than primary lung epithelial cells. Naltrexone is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of alcohol dependence or prevention of relapse from opioid addiction. Since naltrexone binds with high affinity to both MOR and DOR, it was selected as the platform for development of novel ligands capable of delivering a cytotoxic payload to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study outlines the synthesis of two ligands, with peptide or PEG linkers that were synthesized from 6-amino-naltrexone and conjugated with rhodamine dye or Tc-99m for in vitro imaging, binding affinity or in vivo imaging and biodistribution studies. Transfected HEK cells were used as a model system for over-expression of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) or the delta-opioid receptor (DOR). Naltrexone and naltrindole were used as competition for MOR and DOR respectively during the binding affinity studies. Mice bearing a xenograft of HEI( cells transfected with mu (HEK-mu) or delta (HEK-delta) opioid receptors were the animal model used for PET imaging and in vivo biodistribution studies. Although the binding affinity studies were encouraging, the biodistribution data for the selected conjugates lacked sufficient specificity. These conjugates were abandoned from further development but information about their synthesis may be valuable to other laboratories working in this field. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Advancements in information, communication, and sensor technologies have led to new opportunities in medical care and education. Patients in general prefer visiting the nearest clinic, attempt to avoid waiting for treatment, and have unequal preferences for different clinics and doctors. Therefore, to enable patients to compare multiple clinics, this study proposes a ubiquitous multicriteria clinic recommendation system. In this system, patients can send requests through their cell phones to the system server to obtain a clinic recommendation. Once the patient sends this information to the system, the system server first estimates the patient's speed according to the detection results of a global positioning system. It then applies a fuzzy integer nonlinear programming-ordered weighted average approach to assess four criteria and finally recommends a clinic with maximal utility to the patient. The proposed methodology was tested in a field experiment, and the experimental results showed that it is advantageous over two existing methods in elevating the utilities of recommendations. In addition, such an advantage was shown to be statistically significant.

"Aerodynamic and aeroelastic flutter-driven triboelectric nanogenerators are successfully used to harvest broadband airflow energy. The unit component of the flutter membrane consists of thin, free-standing Al foil electrodes covered on both sides with electrospun poly(vinyl chloride) nanofiber-structured mats, which provide advantageous tribo-surfaces specifically to increase the friction area. The airflow-induced triboelectric power generation from a single unit of the flutter-membrane-based triboelectric nanogenerator (FM-TENG) was up to 0.33 mu W under a mild airflow condition. The use of a multi-layered triboelectric nanogenerator, fabricated by simply stacking the single units, can improve the output performance of the device. In a separate configuration, we designed a novel FM-TENG structure by mounting an aeroelastic flutter-belt adapted for use with a fluttermembrane energy-harvester. A rubber belt, which was sandwiched between the flutter membranes, created a rapid periodic vibrational mode via aeroelastic fluttering, synergistically harvesting triboelectric energy with the application of a constant air stream through the closed channel of the FM-TENG. Thus, our flutter-membranebased approach creates a sustainable and cost-efficient energy harvesting system for collecting broadband airflow energy. Furthermore, the aerodynamic and aeroelastic FM-TENG have great potential to be used in numerous areas of self-powered electronic systems and in-situ wireless sensor applications for automobiles or aircraft.

"A wealth of observational studies show that low testosterone is associated with insulin resistance and with an increased risk of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Experimental studies have identified potential mechanisms by which low testosterone may lead to insulin resistance. Visceral adipose tissue is an important intermediate in this relationship. Actions of testosterone or its metabolite oestradiol on other tissues such as muscle, liver, bone or the brain, and body composition-independent effects may also play a role. However, definitive evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to clarify whether the association of low testosterone with disordered glucose metabolism is causative is currently lacking. It therefore remains possible that this association is due to reverse causation, or simply originates by association with common health and lifestyle factors. RCTs of testosterone therapy in men with or without diabetes consistently show modest metabolically favourable changes in body composition. Despite this, testosterone effects on glucose metabolism have been inconsistent. Recent evidence suggests that the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis suppression in the majority of obese men with metabolic disorders is functional, and may be, at least in part, reversible with weight loss. Until further evidence is available, lifestyle measures with emphasis on weight reduction, treatment of comorbidities and optimisation of diabetic control should remain the first-line treatment in these men. Such measures, if successful, may be sufficient to normalise testosterone levels in men with metabolic disorders, who typically have only modest reductions in circulating testosterone levels.

However, few studies have focused on the gray matter alterations of Trigeminal neuralgia (TN). In this study, twenty-eight TN patients (thirteen females; mean age, 45.86 years +/- 11.17) and 28 healthy controls (HC; thirteen females; mean age, 44.89 years +/- 7.67) were included. Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), we detected abnormalities in gray matter volume in the TN patients.

In addition, we found that the gray matter volume in the bilateral STG/MTG was negatively correlated with the duration of TN. These results provide compelling evidence for gray matter abnormalities in TN and suggest that the duration of TN may be a critical factor associated with brain alterations.

"ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism caused by a pituitary adenoma [Cushing's disease (CD)] is the most common cause of endogenous Cushing's syndrome. CD is often associated with several morbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis/bone fractures, secondary infections, and increased cardiovascular mortality. While the majority (approximate to 80%) of the corticotrophinomas visible on pituitary magnetic resonance imaging are microadenomas (MICs,= 10 mm) with increased growth potential and invasiveness, exceptionally exhibiting malignant demeanor. In addition, larger and invasive MACs are associated with a significant increased risk of local complications, such as hypopituitarism and visual defects. Given the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of corticotrophinomas, the aim of this study was to investigate the pattern of genetic differential expression between MIC and MAC, including the invasiveness grade as a criterion for categorizing these tumors. In this study, were included tumor samples from patients with clinical, laboratorial, radiological, and histopathological diagnosis of hypercortisolism due to an ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma. Differential gene expression was studied using an Affymetrix microarray platform in 12 corticotrophinomas, classified as non-invasive MIC (n = 4) and MAC (n = 5), and invasive MAC (n = 3), according to modified Hardy criteria. Somatic mutations in USP8 were also investigated, but none of the patients exhibited USP8 variants. Differential expression analysis demonstrated that non-invasive MIC and MAC have a similar genetic signature, while invasive MACs exhibited a differential expression profile. Among the genes differentially expressed, we highlighted CCND2, ZNF676, DAPK1, and TIMP2, and their differential expression was validated through quantitative real-time PCR in another cohort of 15 non-invasive and 3 invasive cortocotrophinomas. We also identified potential biological pathways associated with growth and invasiveness, TGF-beta and G protein signaling pathways, DNA damage response pathway, and pathways associated with focal adhesion. Our study revealed a differential pattern of genetic signature in a subgroup of MAC, supporting a genetic influence on corticotrophinomas in patients with CD.

We set out to describe current surgical practice in the management of pCD in the UK. Method A survey of surgical management of pCD was designed by an expert group of colorectal surgeons and gastroenterologists. This assessed acute, elective, multidisciplinary and definitive surgical management. A pilot of the questionnaire was undertaken at the 2015 meeting of the Digestive Disease Federation. The survey was refined and distributed nationally through the trainee collaborative networks. Results National rollout obtained responses from 133 of 179 surgeons approached (response rate 74.3%). At first operation, 32% of surgeons would always consider drainage of sepsis and 31.1% would place a draining seton. At first elective operation, 66.6% would routinely insert of draining seton, and 84.4% would avoid cutting seton. An IBD multidisciplinary team was available to 87.6% of respondents, although only 25.1% routinely discussed pCD patients. Anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha therapy was routinely considered by 64.2%, although 44.2% left medical management to gastroenterologists. Common definitive procedures were removal of the seton only (70.7%), fistulotomy (57.1%), advancement flap (38.9%), fistula plug (36.4%) and ligation of intersphincteric track (LIFT) procedure (31.8%). Indications for diverting stoma or proctectomy were intractable sepsis, incontinence and poor quality of life. Conclusion This survey has demonstrated areas of common practice, but has also highlighted divergent practice including choices of definitive surgery and multimodal management.

"A Summary Cannabis use is rising in the USA. Its relationship to cannabinoid signaling in bone cells implies its use could affect bone mineral density (BMD) in the population. In a national survey of people ages 20-59, we found no association between self-reported cannabis use and BMD of the hip or spine. Introduction Cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in the USA, and its recreational use has recently been approved in several US states. Cannabinoids play a role in bone homeostasis. We aimed to determine the association between cannabis use and BMD in US adults. Methods In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2010, 4743 participants between 20 and 59 years old, history of cannabis use was categorized into never, former (previous use, but not in last 30 days), light (1-4 days of use in last 30 days), and heavy (>= 5 days of use in last 30 days). Multivariable linear regression was used to test the association between cannabis use and DXA BMD of the proximal femur and lumbar spine with adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and race/ethnicity among other BMD determinants. Results Sixty percent of the population reported ever using cannabis; 47% were former users, 5% were light users, and 7% were heavy users. Heavy cannabis users were more likely to be male, have a lower BMI, increased daily alcohol intake, increased tobacco pack-years, andweremore likely to have used other illegal drugs (cocaine, heroin, or methamphetamines). No association between cannabis and BMD was observed for any level of use (p >= 0.28). Conclusions A history of cannabis use, although highly prevalent and related to other risk factors for low BMD, was not independently associated with BMD in this cross-sectional study of American men and women.

Since this wicking geotextile consists of wicking fibers, they can wick water out from unsaturated soils in a pavement structure thus resulting in an increase of soil resilient modulus and enhance performance of roadways. In this study, a physical model test was developed to evaluate the effectiveness of the wicking geotextile in soil moisture reduction for roadway applications. A test box with a dimension of 1041 mm in length, 686 mm in width, and 584 mm in heighr was used in this study. Two HDPE plastic panels were used to separate the box into two sections, one containing a dehumidifier and the other backfilled with soil. The dehumidifier was adopted to collect the water, which was wicked out from the soil by the wicking geotextile and evaporated into air. Test results show that (1) the wicking geotextile wicked water out from the soil even at the moisture content close to the optimum moisture content and (2) the comparison of soil moisture contents before and after rainfall demonstrated that the wicking geotextile maintained the soil moisture contents after rainfall close to those before rainfall and had an effective distance for the soil moisture reduction.

Compound 7f also had noteworthy inhibitory effects on selfinduced A beta(1-42) aggregation (50.8 +/- 0.82%) and was found to disaggregate self- (i)nduced A beta(1-42) aggregation (38.7 +/- 0.65%), which was further elucidated by the transmission electron microscopy. Meanwhile, compound 7f showed the modest antioxidant activity (0.55 eq of Trolox), good protective effect against H2O2-induced PC12 cell injury, with low toxicity. Moreover, compound 7f could cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vitro. Significantly, compound 7f did not exhibit any acute toxicity in mice at doses up to 1000 mg/ kg, and the step-down passive avoidance test showed this compound significantly reversed scopolamine- induced memory deficit in mice. Taken together, the results indicated that compound 7f is a very promising multifunctional agent in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, particularly the advanced stages of AD.

"Actual software project feasibility assessment is one of the foremost challenging and vital activities in estimating economics of software before its actual development. Therefore, prototyping in recent years, gradually become an approach to decide various options and possible outcomes before its real implementation and success of the projects. Most of the prototype studies in software engineering acts as a good pointer to envision and reflect upon the final product prediction. However, there has been dearth so far for a detailed economic analysis accountable for benefits, opportunities, risks and costs (BOCR) merits arising from various influencing factors (criteria and sub-criteria.). Further to determine the final possible outcomes (alternatives) through the trade-offs between the BOCR models. The present work attempts to close this gap. The modeling is performed in association with two types of models: analytic network process (ANP) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) with complex relations between influencing factors. The former is illustrated as BOCR-ANP in the form of a control network and analysed through questionnaire based on expert judgement and historic data. The latter BOCR-AHP as a strategic hierarchy via real time data collected from the defect consolidation log data sets through linguistic variables proposed by same authors in our previous work. Thus we propose to investigate prototype dependability model through the inputs arising from expert judgement and real time data. More importantly our proposed model is realized without constructing actual working model. It is an analytical model based on inputs from past experience. The model can be a replacement for a working model for smaller/medium projects or additional inputs to strengthen working model for larger complex software systems. Thus our paper proposes a holistic model to assess the prototype dependability in software at prototype level in early in the software life cycle process. We carried over a case study to examine the proposed approach and to evaluate the economic feasibility of projects in I. T. industry.

We extend our recent paper which provided a benchmark for testing non-rigid 3D shape retrieval algorithms on 3D human models. This benchmark provided a far stricter challenge than previous shape benchmarks. We have added 145 new models for use as a separate training set, in order to standardise the training data used and provide a fairer comparison. We have also included experiments with the FAUST dataset of human scans. All participants of the previous benchmark study have taken part in the new tests reported here, many providing updated results using the new data. In addition, further participants have also taken part, and we provide extra analysis of the retrieval results. A total of 25 different shape retrieval methods are compared.

"Although most business application data is stored in relational databases, programming languages and wire formats in integration middleware systems are not table-centric. Due to costly format conversions, data-shipments and faster computation, the trend is to ""push-down"" the integration operations closer to the storage representation. We address the alternative case of defining declarative, table-centric integration semantics within standard integration systems. For that, we replace the current operator implementations for the well-known Enterprise Integration Patterns by equivalent ""in-memory"" table processing, and show a practical realization in a conventional integration system for a non-reliable, ""data-intensive"" messaging example. The results of the runtime analysis show that table-centric processing is promising already in standard, ""single-record"" message routing and transformations, and can potentially excel the message throughput for ""multi-record"" table messages.

"A multifunctional control strategy for a single-phase asymmetrical cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter (ACHMI), suitable for microgrid systems with nonlinear loads, is presented. The primary advantage of ACHMI is to produce a staircase output voltage with low harmonic content utilizing unequal dc voltages on the individual H-bridge cells. In a grid-connected mode of operation, the control strategy of theACHMIis based on the conservative power theory, providing selective disturbing current compensation besides injecting its available energy. In autonomous mode of operation, two different control methods along with a damping resistor in the filter circuit are developed for regulation of the ACHMI instantaneous output voltage in a variety of load conditions. The first method is a single-loop voltage control scheme without the need of any current measurement. The second one is a multiloop voltage control scheme with a load current feedforward compensation strategy and preservation of the grid-connected current control scheme. The steady-state response and stability of both voltage control schemes are analyzed, and based on the application requirement, the control schemes are implemented individually. The effectiveness of each control strategy is experimentally verified using a hardware-in-the-loop setup with the control algorithm implemented in the TMSF28335 DSP microcontroller.

AMPs have been proven to have crucial role with a wide range of biological activities, mainly with immunomodulatory and broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against various pathogens. The unique and salient features of the AMPs show its exceptional nature of therapeutic activity and serves as an alternative agent for conventional antibiotics. The search for potential AMPs persist, as the emergence of multiple drug resistant bacterial strains has been spreading in higher number. Here, the putative antimicrobial peptide sequences were identified from 19,915 sequences of prawn transcriptome and analyzed with various in silico tools such as EXPASY, AMPA, and helical wheel projection and so on. The characteristic antimicrobial properties have been determined for 660 putative AMPs with above mentioned tools. We have demonstrated an efficient bioinformatics approach to derive and analyze the AMPs from the transcriptome data of Macrobrachium rosenbergii. Even though, 660 peptide regions were identified among those five peptide sequences were demonstrated comprehensively with each characteristic property contributes the antimicrobial activity. In this study, we have proposed a rapid and successful protocol that would help to predict AMP in sequential procedure using various in silico methods. Also, we have shown a distinctive method to shortlist the AMPs based on their various physico-chemical properties.

"A fuzzy just-in-time (JIT) ubiquitous service networked system is established in this study. This system is an innovative application of mobile commerce, ubiquitous computing, and ambient intelligence. The intended user is a traveler who must decide on the best service location along the planned route; the system arranges the service when the user demands it, so that when the user arrives at the service location the required service is ready. This system applies the ""just-in-time"" concept to mobile commerce, ubiquitous computing, and ambient intelligence. This innovation has great potential for providing better services in these fields. The issue of how to determine the JIT service location and path in a ubiquitous service network is critical; however, because data about the user's position is inaccurate, the task is difficult. To tackle this difficulty, a FINLP model is formulated, and a fuzzy version of Dijkstra's algorithm is proposed. A test system has been established to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed methodology. Based on the experimental results, the proposed JIT ubiquitous service networked system was able to reduce the user's average waiting time by 74%.

"Adjuvant chemotherapy is an important component in the treatment of gastric cancer (GC) patients; however, some patients do not respond to the drugs. We aimed to develop a practical profile based on serum microRNAs (miRNAs) that can be used to predict patients likely to respond to treatment. Microarrays were used to screen cisplatin-resistant SGC7901/DDP GC cells and the parental SGC7901 cell lines for miRNAs related to chemotherapy sensitivity. The correlation between the expression patterns of identified serum miRNAs and overall survival was confirmed in 68 GC patients. Furthermore, we also validated the signature of the serum miRNAs in an independent cohort of 50 GC patients. From the screening microarrays, we focused on miR-15a, miR-15b and miR-93 as downregulated miRNAs in the SGC7901/DDP cells and miR-27a, miR-106a and miR-664 as upregulated miRNAs. Only serum miR-106, miR-15a, miR-93 and miR-664 were useful in predicting the prognosis of patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy. We identified a signature of four serum miRNAs (miR-106, miR-15a, miR-93 and miR-664) that, when combined, can be used as a risk score for overall survival. Patients with a higher risk score had worse prognosis (p < 0.05). For the independent cohort of patients, the signature of the four miRNAs predicted prognosis well. Our data showed that the risk score derived from the four serum miRNAs was closely associated with the overall survival in GC patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy.

"A flexible Cartesian manipulator is a coupling system with a moving rigid body and flexible structures. Thus, vibration suppression problem must be solved to guarantee the stability and control accuracy. A characteristic model based nonlinear golden section adaptive control (CMNGSAC) algorithm is implemented to suppress the vibration of a flexible Cartesian smart material manipulator driven by a ballscrew mechanism using an AC servomotor. The system modeling is derived to recognize the dynamical characteristics. The closed loop stability is analyzed based on the model. Also, an experimental setup is constructed to verify the adopted method. Experimental comparison studies are conducted for modal frequencies' identification and active vibration control of the flexible manipulator. The active vibration control experiments include set-point vibration control responses, vibration suppression under resonant excitation and simultaneous translating and vibration suppression using different control methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the controller can suppress both the larger and the lower amplitude vibration near the equilibrium point effectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"A field enquiry mentioned the potential positive impact of a feed restriction on the health of young rabbits, but no objective information relates the intake to digestive health. The effects of a post-weaning feed restriction strategy were thus studied on digestive health and growth and carcass parameters of the growing rabbit, using a monofactorial design that produces a quantitative linear reduction of the intake, from ad libitum (AL group) to 80%, 70% and 60% of AL. The study was performed simultaneously in six experimental sites, on 1984 growing rabbits (496 per treatment) collectively caged from weaning (34 to 38 days of age, depending on the site) to slaughter (68 to 72 days). The feeding programme was applied as followed: restriction during 21 days after weaning, and then ad libitum till slaughter During the feed restriction period the growth rate was linearly reduced with the restriction level, by 0.5 g/day for each percent of intake reduction. When returning to ad libitum intake (after 54 days old) a compensatory growth and a higher feed efficiency occurred. Therefore, the impact of the feeding programme on the slaughter weight (SW) was significant (-4.5 g/% of restriction), but relatively moderate: the weight loss of the more-restricted rabbits (60%) reached 7.7% (-200 g) compared to the AL group. Over the whole fattening period the feed restriction reduced linearly and significantly the feed conversion (FC) (-0.0077 unit/% of restriction). Carcass traits were little affected by the feeding programme, except for a slightly lower decrease of the dressing percentage (mean: 1.2 units between AL and the three restricted groups). On the six experimental sites, mortality and morbidity were always caused by acute digestive disorders, namely diarrhoea and/or caecal impaction. Independent of the treatment, the mortality rate strongly varied according to the site (between 7% and 18% from weaning to 54 days and for the AL group). During feed restriction, the mortality was significantly lower from a restriction threshold of 80% (meanly: -9% compared to AL). The morbidity was also significantly reduced (-6%) for the two most restricted groups (70% and 60%). The favourable effect of a lower intake on health did not persist after returning to ad libitum intake (54 days to slaughter), since mortality and morbidity were not significantly different among the treatments. Such a feeding strategy thus represents a double benefit in terms of feed costs and lower losses of young rabbits.

"Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is postulated to affect dementia. Our study aims to investigate the relationship between ARHL and the prevalence, and 10-year incidence of dementia in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD).

A comparison cohort comprising of patients without ARHL was frequency-matched by age, sex, and co-morbidities, and the occurrence of dementia was evaluated in both cohorts. The ARHL cohort consisted of 4108 patients with ARHL and the control cohort consisted of 4013 frequency-matched patients without ARHL. The incidence of dementia [hazard ratio (HR), 1.30; 95% confidence interval (CI 1.14-1.49); P = 0.002] was higher among ARHL patients. Cox models showed that being female (HR, 1.34; 95% CI 1.07-1.68), as well as having co-morbidities, including chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke, head injury, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, alcohol abuse/dependence, and tobacco abuse/dependence (HR, 1.27; 95% CI 1.11-1.45), were independent risk factors for dementia in ARHL patients. We found ARHL may be one of the early characteristics of dementia, and patients with hearing loss were at a higher risk of subsequent dementia. Clinicians should be more sensitive to dementia symptoms within the first 2 years following ARHL diagnosis. Further clinical studies of the relationship between dementia and ARHL may be necessary.

"A novel approach is proposed in this study to eliminate the chaotic motion by a fuzzy controller and an appropriate dither. First, a back-propagation (BP) neural-network (NN) model is used to approximate the multiple time-delay chaotic system. Then, a linear differential inclusion (LDI) state-space representation is established for the dynamics of the NN model. Based on the LDI state-space representation, this study proposes a delay-dependent stability criterion derived in terms of Lyapunov's direct method to guarantee that the trajectories of the multiple time-delay chaotic (MTDC) system under fuzzy control can be steered into a periodic orbit. Subsequently, the stability condition of this criterion is reformulated into a linear matrix inequality (LMI). According to the LMI, a fuzzy controller is then synthesized to tame the multiple time-delay chaotic (MTDC) system. If the fuzzy controller cannot suppress the chaos, a high frequency signal, commonly called dither, is simultaneously injected to eliminate the chaotic motion by regulating the dither's parameters. If the frequency of dither is high enough, the trajectories of the dithered chaotic system and its corresponding mathematical model-the relaxed system can be made as close as desired. This make it possible to obtain a rigorous prediction of the dithered chaotic system's behavior by establishing the relaxed system. Finally, this study provides a numerical example of the Chen's chaotic system with simulations to illustrate the concepts discussed throughout this paper. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

"A stereovision based methodology to estimate the position, speed and heading of a moving marine vehicle from a pursuing unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is considered, in support of enabling a USV to follow a target vehicle in motion. The methodology involves stereovision ranging, object detection and tracking, and minimization of tracking error due to image quantization limitations and pixel miscorrespondences in the stereo pixel-matching process. The method consists of combining a simple stereovision-matching algorithm, together with a predictive-corrective approach based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF), and use of suitable choices of probabilistic models representing the motion of the target vehicle and the stereovision measurements. Simple matching algorithms perform faster at the expense of potential errors in depth measurement. The approach considered aims to minimize the tracking errors related to such errors in stereovision measurements, thereby improving the accuracy of the state estimation of the vehicle. Results from simulations and a real-time implementation reveal the effectiveness of the system to compute accurate estimates of the state of the target vehicle over non-compliant trajectories subjected to a variety of motion conditions.

"A three-degrees of freedom (3-DOF) coupled numerical simulation technique for synchronously extracting 18 aerodynamic derivatives of bridge decks is proposed and evaluated in this study. Computations are performed with a finite volume unstructured computational flow dynamics (CFD) solver using two-dimensional (2D) hybrid meshes with fine near-wall resolution. The accuracy of the numerical model is verified by identifying the aerodynamic derivatives of one thin plate section with theoretical solutions. Further, for two typical deck sections (streamlined and bluff) of two long-span bridges, the extracted 18 aerodynamic derivatives from both coupled and uncoupled techniques are compared. The results showed good agreement with the experimental results. The proposed 3-DOF coupled method can provide almost the same level of accuracy as the 1-DOF method and saves about 67% of the computation time. The appropriateness of the linear superposition theorem for the aeroelastic forces generated by different motions (single and coupled mode) is examined, and found that there are significant differences in both aerostatic and aeroelastic forces. Various high-order aeroelastic force components are successfully captured by the newly presented coupled numerical simulation, and the aerodynamic derivatives are proved to be immune to the high-order components mathematically. This knowledge is essential for a thorough evaluation of aerodynamic derivatives identification accuracy. The proposed technique and the analytical viewpoints presented in this paper may serve as the building block for developing new numerical tools and analytical frameworks for rapid and accurate evaluation of aerodynamic derivatives, and the response of long-span flexible bridges to wind excitation.

"A novel estimator for the identification of continuous-time linear time-varying systems is presented in this paper. The estimator uses kernel-based regression to identify the time-varying coefficients of a linear ordinary differential equation, based on noisy samples of the input and output signals. The estimator adopts a mixed time- and frequency-domain formulation, which allows it to be formulated as the solution of a set of algebraic equations, without relying on finite differences to approximate the time derivatives. Since a kernel-based approach is used, the model complexity selection of the time-varying parameters is formulated as an optimisation problem with continuous variables. Variance and bias expressions of the estimate are derived and validated on a simulation example. Also, it is shown that, in highly noisy environments, the proposed kernel-based estimator provides more reliable results than an Oracle'-based estimator which is deprived of regularisation.

"ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10) is the alpha-secretase that is involved in APP(beta-amyloid precursor protein) processing. Enhancement of the nonamyloidogenic APP pathway by ADAM10 provides therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease (AD). By using high-throughput screening that targeted ADAM10, we determined that apicidin-an inhibitor of HDACs(histone deacetylases)-significantly increased mRNA and protein levels of ADAM10 in SH-SY5Y cells. A luciferase assay revealed that the nucleotides 2444 to 2300 in the ADAM10 promoter were sufficient to mediate this effect. In addition, knockdown of USF1 (upstream transcription factor 1) and HDAC2/3 prevented apicidin regulation of ADAM10. Moreover, USF1 acetylation was increased by apicidin, which enhanced the association of USF1 with HDAC2/3 and with the ADAM10 promoter. We further found that apicidin did not affect the phosphorylation of ERK or USF1; however, ERK inhibitor U0126 blocked the effect of apicidin on ADAM10. Finally, apicidin increased the level of a-site C-terminal fragment from APP and reduced the production of b-amyloid peptide 1-42. Collectively, our study provides evidence that ADAM10 expression can be regulated by HDAC2/3 inhibitor apicidin via USF1-dependent mechanisms in which ERK signaling plays an important role.

"A behavioural theory consists of machine-independent postulates characterizing a particular class of algorithms or systems, an abstract machine model that provably satisfies these postulates, and a rigorous proof that any algorithm or system stipulated by the postulates is captured by the abstract machine model. The class of interest in this article is that of (synchronous) parallel algorithms. For this class a behavioural theory has already been developed by Blass and Gurevich, which unfortunately, though mathematically correct, fails to be convincing, as it is not intuitively clear that the postulates really capture the essence of (synchronous) parallel algorithms. In this article we present a much simpler (and presumably more convincing) set of four postulates for (synchronous) parallel algorithms, which are rather close to those used in Gurevich's celebrated sequential ASM thesis, i.e. the behavioural theory of sequential algorithms. The key difference is made by an extension of the bounded exploration postulate using multiset comprehension terms instead of ground terms formulated over the signature of the states. in addition, all implicit assumptions are made explicit, which amounts to considering states of a parallel algorithm to be represented by meta-finite first order structures. The article first provides the necessary evidence that the axiomatization presented in this article characterizes indeed the whole class of (synchronous) parallel algorithms, then formally proves that parallel algorithms are captured by Abstract State Machines (ASMs). The proof requires some recourse to methods from finite model theory, by means of which it can be shown that if a critical tuple defines an update in some update set, then also every bther tuple that is logically indistinguishable defines an update in that update set.

Studies investigating chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency have reported conflicting results and few have employed multiple diagnostic imaging modalities across a large patient and control population. In this study, three complementary imaging modalities were used to investigate the chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency hypothesis in patients with multiple sclerosis and two age- and sex-matched control groups: healthy volunteers and patients with other neurological diseases. Strictly blinded Doppler ultrasound according to the original chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency hypothesis; four-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging of venous flow in the head, neck, and chest; and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venography for neck and chest venous luminography were acquired. An internal jugular vein stenosis evaluation was also performed across modalities. Percentage of subjects meeting ultrasound-based chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency criteria was small and similar between groups. In group-wise and pairwise testing, no four-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging variables were statistically significantly different, for any measurement location. In contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venography of the internal jugular and azygos veins, no statistically significant differences were observed in stenosis scores between groups. These results represent compelling evidence against the chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency hypothesis in multiple sclerosis.

"As a primary disturbance agent, fire significantly influences local processes and services of forest ecosystems. Although a variety of remote sensing based approaches have been developed and applied to Landsat mission imagery to infer burn severity at 30 m spatial resolution, forest burn severity have still been seldom assessed at fine spatial scales (5 m) from very-high-resolution (VHR) data. We assessed a 432 ha forest fire that occurred in April 2012 on Long Island, New York, within the Pine Barrens region, a unique but imperiled fire-dependent ecosystem in the northeastern United States. The mapping of forest burn severity was explored here at fine spatial scales, for the first time using remotely sensed spectral indices and a set of Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) fraction images from bi-temporal pre- and post-fire event - WorldView-2 (WV-2) imagery at 2 m spatial resolution. We first evaluated our approach using 1 m by 1 m validation points at the sub-crown scale per severity class (i.e. unburned, low, moderate, and high severity) from the post-fire 0.10 m color aerial ortho-photos; then, we validated the burn severity mapping of geo-referenced dominant tree crowns (crown scale) and 15 m by 15 m fixed-area plots (inter-crown scale) with the post-fire 0.10 m aerial ortho-photos and measured crown information of twenty forest inventory plots. Our approach can accurately assess forest burn severity at the sub-crown (overall accuracy is 84% with a Kappa value of 0.77), crown (overall accuracy is 82% with a Kappa value of 0.76), and inter-crown scales (89% of the variation in estimated burn severity ratings (i.e. Geo-Composite Burn Index (CBI)). This work highlights that forest burn severity mapping from VHR data can capture heterogeneous fire patterns at fine spatial scales over the large spatial extents. This is important since most ecological processes associated with fire effects vary at the <30 m scale and VHR approaches could significantly advance our ability to characterize fire effects on forest ecosystems.

"Agility is a concept and practice with significant importance in managing projects and organizations, although it can also be very risky due to its degree of fuzziness if not properly defined. This research re-defines agility, emphasizes the need for ontologies for its management, and creates an application to measure the degree of agility inside an organization. In this research, various definitions of agility were gathered for the creation of ontology through a mind map revealing the characteristics of agility. As part of the Co-Evolute theory and methodology, the first agility ontology was developed as well as an application that evaluates the degree of agility in an organization. The application includes statements on which the respondents give opinions concerning the current and future desired states of agility and its importance in an evaluative way. The application has proven to operate well and extensive validation and verification of the tests runs will follow.

"A simplified method for predicting the deflections of cable-stayed suspension bridges considering live loads is presented. In the proposed method the governing equation of the cable-stayed suspension bridge, based on potential energy method, is derived. A Fourier series is used to describe the defections of the bridge deck. It has been shown from the numerical investigation of two different cable-stayed suspension bridges that the iteration procedure has a very high convergence rate. Only a few iterations are needed and a small number of series terms are sufficient for achieving the solutions of the problems. The predictions of the proposed method show good agreement with finite element results.

"Anonymous systems on the Internet aim to protect users from revealing to an external unauthorized entity their identities and their network activities. Despite using layered encryption, these systems are still vulnerable to timing analysis, wherein an eavesdropper can use traffic correlation mechanisms to identify the source of packets arriving at a destination. Mixes are intelligent routers or proxy servers that aim to provide packet source anonymity from timing analysis by delaying and shuffling the order of received packets prior to transmission. Such shuffling strategies naturally increase latency and result in a tradeoff between anonymity and latency. This paper investigates this tradeoff in a network of mixes, by deriving the optimal routing for sources which maximizes weighted sum of anonymity and delay. The achievable anonymity is characterized analytically for a general multipath model, and it is shown that under light traffic conditions, there exists a unique single route strategy, which achieves the optimal delay anonymity tradeoff. A low complexity algorithm is presented that derives the optimal routes to achieve a desired tradeoff. The light traffic results are specialized for a graphical model of existing practical anonymous systems, and optimal scaling behavior with the size of such networks is characterized. In the heavy traffic regime, it is shown that optimal anonymity is achieved for any allocation of rates across the different routes. Simulations on example networks are presented where it is shown that the optimal routes derived under light traffic performs quite well in general traffic regime.

"4D printing, which is the combination of 3D printing technology and printable smart materials, provides the potential of automating actuation devices. In this paper, we have used a modifiedfused deposition modelling 3D printing technology to fabricate a double-layer laminate smart material, which can be activated by temperature directly or by an electric circuit indirectly. A double-layer laminate mathematical model has been developed to describe the bending behaviour caused by the mismatch strain between the surface layer and the basal layer. The electrocaloric deformation testings were performed to find the different bending rules of this low-cost printed active composite in different physical states. The considerable maximal deformation values and deformation force (7 mm and 100 mN for these carbon fibre (CF)/polylactic acid specimens, and 10 mm and 200 mN for these CF/polyether-ether-ketone specimens in the paper) provide this double-layer smart material and 4D printing method the prospective to be applied in biomimetic sensors, actuators, transducers, and artificial muscles.

"Accessible Summary In England and Wales, some people with learning disabilities may have to be detained under the Mental Health Act 2007 as patients in a hospital for a period of assessment and or treatment if they are suffering from a mental disorder, and it is for the interests of their own health and safety, or to protect others. Patients who are detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act 2007 can apply to the Mental Health Tribunal to decide whether they should be detained in a psychiatric hospital or be discharged. The Mental Health Tribunal has the power to discharge these patients after a hearing. Patients who lack capacity to apply to the tribunal are unable to have a tribunal hearing. The European Court has ruled that this is unfair to these patients. There needs to be a system in place to ensure that these patients get a tribunal hearing. Abstract Background In the UK, the Mental Health Tribunal is a long-established safeguard for patients detained under the Mental Health Act. This gives such patients an effective appeal mechanism to ensure legal protection of their liberty. This act contains sections that allow for civil detention in the case of mental disorder. The right to apply to the tribunal against such detention is underpinned by the right to liberty under Article 5 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR). Some patients with learning disabilities may lack capacity and the ability to challenge their detention. Method This article presents a case study of a woman with Down's syndrome and severe learning disabilities. Whilst this woman was detained under the Mental Health Act, she could have applied for a review of her detention to the Mental Health Tribunal within 14days. She did not do so because she lacked capacity to instruct solicitors. Subsequently, as a result of appeal, the case proceeded through English and European judicial review. Results The European Court of Human Rights, in the case of MH v UK (2013), has ruled that the appeals procedure for patients without capacity detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act is not compatible with Article 5(4) of the European Convention of Human Rights. The European Court has ruled that special procedural safeguards are required to enable this cohort of patients to exercise their rights guaranteed by Article 5(4). Conclusions Responsible clinicians [treating consultant psychiatrists] need to ensure that all patients detained under section 2 of the Mental Health Act have an assessment of their capacity to apply to the tribunal. There need to be systems in place to alert hospital managers when a patient lacks capacity to apply for a tribunal. Hospital managers should request the Secretary of State to apply for a tribunal in these instances. Knowledge of this ruling is relevant to informing the practice of other interdisciplinary healthcare professionals working with such patients.

"An accurate algorithm for three-dimensional (3-D) pose recognition of a rigid object is presented. The algorithm is based on adaptive template matched filtering and local search optimization. When a scene image is captured, a bank of correlation filters is constructed to find the best correspondence between the current view of the target in the scene and a target image synthesized by means of computer graphics. The synthetic image is created using a known 3-D model of the target and an iterative procedure based on local search. Computer simulation results obtained with the proposed algorithm in synthetic and real-life scenes are presented and discussed in terms of accuracy of pose recognition in the presence of noise, cluttered background, and occlusion. Experimental results show that our proposal presents high accuracy for 3-D pose estimation using monocular images. (C) 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

"A pilot project was conducted to examine the health status and possible adverse health effects associated with seawater exposure (microbial water-quality indicators and phytoplankton abundance and their toxins) of surfers in Monterey Bay, Central California coastal waters. Forty-eight surfers enrolled in the study and completed an initial health background survey and weekly health surveys online using Survey Monkey. Descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equation, a regression technique, were used to identify longitudinal and correlated results. The surfers were predominately Caucasian, male, and physically active. They surfed approximately 4 h a week. Their average age was 34 years. The data indicated that the surfers were generally ""healthy,'' with a low prevalence of diabetes, high cholesterol, and hypertension. Their most common health problems were allergies and asthma. During the study, 10% of the surfers reported gastrointestinal symptoms and 29% reported upper respiratory symptoms. This study suggests surfers were significantly more likely to report upper respiratory symptoms when they had a history of allergies, housemates with upper respiratory symptoms, and/or a history of previous adverse health symptoms while surfing during a ""red tide'' (an event often associated with the presence of phytoplankton toxins). Additionally, female surfers reported upper respiratory symptoms more than males.

"A novel dynamic radio-cooperation strategy is proposed for a Cloud Radio Access Network (Cloud-RAN) consisting of multiple Remote Radio Heads connected to a central Virtual Base Station (VBS) pool. In particular, the key capabilities of Cloud-RAN in computing-resource sharing and real-time communication among the VBSs are leveraged to design a joint dynamic radio clustering and cooperative beamforming scheme that maximizes the downlink Weighted Sum-Rate System Utility (WSRSU). Due to the combinatorial nature of the radio clustering process and to the non-convexity of the cooperative beamforming design, the underlying optimization problem is NP-hard, and is extremely difficult to solve for a large network. The proposed approach aims for a suboptimal solution by transforming the original problem into a Mixed-Integer Second-Order Cone Program (MI-SOCP) and applying Sequential Convex Approximation (SCA) to derive a novel iterative algorithm. Numerical simulation results show that our low-complexity algorithm provides near-optimal performance in terms of WSRSU while significantly outperforming conventional radio clustering and beamforming schemes. Additionally, the results also demonstrate the significant improvement in computing-resource utilization of Cloud-RAN over a traditional RAN with distributed computing resources.

"A Mass Customisation model is discussed as a competitive positioning strategy in the marketplace adding value to the customer's end-use. It includes the user as part of the construction process responding to the customer's demands and wishes. To the present day, almost all proposals for Mass Customisation have been focused on the design phase and single family houses. The reality is that the processes carried out in the work execution are so inefficient that the costs of the Mass Customisation models are assumed by the customer and they do not offer solutions that support the change management. Furthermore, this inefficiency often makes Mass Customisation unfeasible in terms of deadlines and site management. Therefore, the present proposal focuses on achieving the paradigm of Mass Customisation in the traditional residential construction complementary to the existing proposals in the design phase. All this through the proposal of a framework for the integral management in the work execution, which will address change management introduced by the users offering an efficient and productive model that reduces costs in the process. This model will focus on the synergy between different strategies, techniques and technologies currently used in the construction management (such as Lean Construction or Six Sigma), together with, other strategies and technologies that have proven to be valid solutions in other fields (such as Business Process Management, Service Oriented Architecture, etc.).

Lead presented the most severe pollution among the metals studied, especially during 1957-1974. The use of leaded petrol and atmospheric deposition of coal combustion flue gases could have contributed to Pb contamination. In spite of the general good quality (mean sediment pollution index (SPI) 35.69) of the sediment core evaluated by SPI based on the principal component analysis, worse sediment qualities in the upper section (<6 cm, 2004) were still observed, suggesting intensive human activities causing the increasing concentrations of metals in recent decades.

"A Summary Twenty-five percent of patients with a non-hip non-vertebral fragility fracture have an undiagnosed vertebral fracture detected by vertebral fracture assessment during bone densitometric assessment. The prevalence of an undiagnosed vertebral fracture is higher in older people, and they are more likely to have multiple vertebral fractures. Purpose Most vertebral fragility fractures (VFF) have no history of trauma. Vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) during dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can be used to detect these VFFs. This study aims to identify the prevalence of undiagnosed VFF in patients presenting with a non-hip non-vertebral fragility fracture. Methods Patients identified by the fracture liaison service (FLS) of a large UK university hospital presenting with a non-hip non-vertebral fragility fracture were evaluated from 1 January 2012 to 30 September 2015. Local protocol identified those that would proceed for VFA. Data was collected on patient characteristics, fracture details, bone mineral density (BMD) measurements and VFA results. Results Five hundred sixty-seven patients (mean (SD) age, 72 (9.4) years) of mostly women (88.3%) had a VFA performed as part of their DXA assessment. One hundred forty-three patients (25.2%) were identified to have a vertebral fracture, of whom 57.3% of them had one fracture. 49.5% of those with vertebral fractures had BMD measurements diagnostic of osteoporosis. Mean (SD) age was higher in those with vertebral fractures compared to those without; 74.9 (8.3) years vs 70.4 (9.5) years, p < 0.00. Those aged 75 years and over were more likely to have multiple fractures than those younger than 75 years (16.3 vs 4%, p = 0.01). Conclusion A quarter of patients presenting with a non-hip non-vertebral fragility fracture have an undiagnosed vertebral fracture. Older people are more likely to have vertebral fractures and more likely to have multiple fractures. VFA during bone densitometric assessment can further aid stratifying future fracture risk.

"A microscope vision system to retrieve small metallic surface via micro laser line scanning and genetic algorithms is presented. In this technique, a 36 pm laser line is projected on the metallic surface through a laser diode head, which is placed to a small distance away from the target. The micro laser line is captured by a CCD camera, which is attached to the microscope. The surface topography is computed by triangulation by means of the line position and microscope vision parameters. The calibration of the microscope vision system is carried out by an adaptive genetic algorithm based on the line position. In this algorithm, an objective function is constructed from the microscope geometry to determine the microscope vision parameters. Also, the genetic algorithm provides the search space to calculate the microscope vision parameters with high accuracy in fast form. This procedure avoids errors produced by the missing of references and physical measurements, which are employed by the traditional microscope vision systems. The contribution of the proposed system is corroborated by an evaluation via accuracy and speed of the traditional microscope vision systems, which retrieve micro-scale surface topography.

"Activation of casein kinase 2 (CK2) is closely linked to the body disturbance of carbohydrate metabolism and inflammatory reaction. The renal chronic inflammatory reaction in the setting of diabetes is one of the important hallmarks of diabetic renal fibrosis. However, it remains unknown whether CK2 influences the process of diabetic renal fibrosis. The current study is aimed to investigate if CK2 alpha ameliorates renal inflammatory fibrosis in diabetes via NF-kappa B pathway. To explore potential regulatory mechanism of CK2 alpha, the expression and activity of CK2 alpha, which were studied by plasmid transfection, selective inhibitor, small-interfering RNA (siRNA) and adenovirus infection in vitro or in vivo, were analyzed by means of western blotting (WB), dual luciferase reporter assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The following findings were observed: (1) Expression of CK2 alpha, was upregulated in kidneys of di:0:lb and KKAy diabetic mice; (2) Inhibition of CK2 alpha kinase activity or knockdown of CK2 alpha protein expression suppressed high glucose-induced expressions of FN and ICAM-1 in glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs); (3) Inhibition of CK2 alpha kinase activity or knockdown of CK2 alpha protein expression not only restrained hcB degradation, but also suppressed HG-induced nuclear accumulation, transcriptional activity and DNA binding activity of NF-kappa B in GMCs; (4) Treatment of TBB or CK2 alpha RNAi adenovirus infection ameliorated renal fibrosis in diabetic animals; (5) Treatment of TBB or CK2 alpha RNAi adenovirus infection suppressed hcB degradation and NF-kappa B nuclear accumulation in glomeruli of diabetic animals. This study indicates the essential role of CK2 alpha in regulating the diabetic renal pathological process of inflammatory fibrosis via NF-kappa B pathway, and inhibition of CK2 alpha may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for diabetic nephropathy.

"A detailed discussion on genesis, determinant and algorithmic method of the harmonic distortion of Switched Capacitor integrator and Switched-Capacitor based second order Sigma-Delta modulator is presented. In many instances, people make harmonic distortion analysis of signal through expanding periodic signal into Fourier series or making Fourier transformation for non-periodic signal respectively. Actually, due to the complexity of transient response of Switched-Capacitor integrator, the output expression of second-order Sigma-Delta modulator loop filter is also not trivial, so we will be in great trouble if traditional method is employed when its harmonics are analyzed and calculated in such a way. A fact that is noteworthy is no matter how complicated the output response of the second integrator of the modulator is, its harmonic expression has the same functional form whether in the whole time domain or at the discrete time moments. From this we turn the harmonic analysis of the continuous-time transient response into another thing, namely computing the harmonic coefficients of the transient response at discrete time moments. The least square method is adopted in process of calculation. When developing the output expression of second-order Sigma-Delta modulator, the following point is clarified, that the harmonic distortion is dominated by the first Switched-Capacitor integrator, owing to the suppression resulted from the closed feedback of harmonic distortion of the second stage is much greater than the first stage. In addition, it is avoided that the harmonic distortion is once again brought into the feedback signal in calculation, through the way that first the additive harmonic error model is utilized to get the transfer function, second replaced by gain model in the form of power series. And by doing so, both the feasibility and simplicity of the analysis and mathematical derivation are enhanced effectively.

"A nondestructive method was developed for assessing total viable count (TVC) in pork during refrigerated storage by using hyperspectral imaging technique in this study. The hyperspectral images in the visible/near-infrared (VIS/NIR) region of 400-1100 nm were acquired for fifty pork samples, and their VIS/NIR diffuse reflectance spectra were extracted from the images. The reference values of TVC in pork samples were determined by classical microbiological plating method. Both partial least square regression (PLSR) model and support vector machine regression model (SVR) of TVC were built for comparative analysis to achieve better results. Different transformation methods and filtering methods were applied to improve the models. The results show that both the optimized PLSR model and SVR model can predict the TVC very well, while the SVR model based on second derivation was better, which achieved with R-P (correlation coefficient of prediction set) = 0.94 and SEP (standard error of prediction set) = 0.4570 log CFU/g in the prediction set. An image processing algorithm was then developed to transfer the prediction model to every pixel of the image of the entire sample; the visualizing map of TVC would be displayed in real-time during the detection process due to the simplicity of the model. The results demonstrated that hyperspectral imaging is a potential reliable approach for non-destructive and real-time prediction of TVC in pork.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the pollution load of composite industrial effluents discharged from the State Infrastructure and Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (SIIDCUL) Integrated Industrial Estate (1E) at Haridwar (Uttarakhand), India with reference to ecological risks. Methodology: Due to large outstretch of industrial area, the industrial complex was divided into four clusters (Cluster A to Cluster D). The effluent samples were collected from the drainage channels marked from the sampling sites at industrial area. Standard methods of APHA (2012) were followed for the analysis of effluents samples. Results: The results revealed that there was a remarkably high pollution load at industrial estate. The effluents discharged from the industrial units at Cluster C were slightly acidic (pH 5.33) and the parameters like TDS (2107.67 mg l(-1)), BOD (453.33 mg l(-1)), COD (1003.3 mg l(-1)) and some heavy metals like Fe (37.38 mg l(-1)), Cr (11.254 mg l(-1)), Cu (4.9 mg l(-1)) and Pb (2.11 mg l(-1)) exceeded the permissible limits as prescribed by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS, 2012), thereby indicating a considerably higher load of pollutants. The load of metals concentration in the effluents of different clusters was found in the following order: Fe>Cd>Zn>Ni>Cr>Cu>Pb>Mn. The higher content of metals in industrial wastewater may be due to the discharge of untreated effluents from metal processing industries. Interpretation: Disposal of effluents can be a source of severe ecological risks in the form of contamination of groundwater, soil, vegetation. Consumption of crops and vegetables irrigated with these effluents may have serious threats to human health, thereby causing a risk of various ailments like encephalopathy, cardiovascular and kidney diseases; muscular pain and intestinal hemorrhage. It is recommended that pollution control and regulatory authorities should periodically monitor the quality of effluents so as to ensure the compliance of prescribed standards.

"A long-term goal of our field is to determine the sequence of pathological events, which ultimately lead to cognitive decline and dementia. In this study, we first assessed the patterns of brain tau tangle accumulation (measured with the positron emission tomography tracer F-18-AV-1451) associated with well-established Alzheimer's disease factors in a cohort including cognitively healthy elderly individuals and individuals at early symptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease. We then explored highly associated patterns of greater F-18-AV-1451 binding and increased annualized change in cortical amyloid-beta plaques measured as florbetapir positron emission tomography binding antecedent to F-18-AV-1451 positron emission tomography scans, and to what extent these multimodal pattern associations explained the variance in cognitive performance and clinical outcome measures, independently and jointly. We found that: (i) F-18-AV-1451 positron emission tomography retention was differentially associated with age, and cross-sectional florbetapir positron emission tomography retention, but not with years of education, gender, or APOE genotype; (ii) increased annualized change in florbetapir retention, antecedent to F-18-AV-1451 positron emission tomography scans, in the parieto-temporal and precuneus brain regions was associated with greater F-18-AV-1451 PET retention most prominently in the inferior temporal and inferior parietal regions in the full cohort, with florbetapir positive/negative-associated variability; and (iii) this F-18-AV-1451 positron emission tomography retention pattern significantly explained the variance in cognitive performance and clinical outcome measures, independent of the associated antecedent increased annualized change in florbetapir positron emission tomography retention. These findings are in agreement with the pathology literature, which suggests that tau tangles but not amyloid-beta plaques correlate with cognition and clinical symptoms. Furthermore, non-local associations linking increased amyloid-beta accumulation rates with increased tau deposition are of great interest and support the idea that the amyloid-beta pathology might have remote effects in disease pathology spread potentially via the brain's intrinsic connectivity networks.

"A large quantity of recent research into the harvesting of electrical energy from ambient vibration sources has been focused on the improvement of device performance via the deliberate introduction of dynamic nonlinearities. In addition to this, the realisation that most of these kinetic energy sources are stochastic in nature has led to many studies focusing on the response of energy harvesters to random vibrations (often Gaussian white noise). This differs from early studies in which it was assumed that ambient vibration sources were sinusoidal. The aim of the present study is to take current nonlinear energy harvesting solutions and to numerically analyse their effectiveness when two real ambient vibration sources are used: human walking motion and the oscillation of the midspan of a suspension bridge. This study shows that the potential improvements that can be realised through the introduction of nonlinearities into energy harvesters are sensitive to the type of ambient excitation to which they are subjected. Additionally, the need for more research into the development of low-frequency energy harvesters is emphasised.

"Acetyl Cholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors such as Donepezil, Rivastigmine and Galantamine are approved by US-FDA as first line drugs to treat the cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Their beneficial effects are attributed to their ability to elevate endogenous acetylcholine (ACh) at the M-1 muscarinic receptor in the brain. However, their side effects such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, insomnia, loss of appetite and altered heart rate are related to non-specific activation of M-2-M-5 muscarinic subtypes in various tissues. It is logical, therefore, to develop agonists with M-1 receptor selectivity. Unfortunately, this is limited due to a high degree of orthosteric site homology among the receptor subtypes. In contrast, their allosteric sites are unique and, therefore, allow selective targeting using positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). PAMs of M-1 receptors are devoid of agonist activity, however, when bound they enhance the binding affinity of orthosteric ligand, ACh. The major limitation of these PAMs is their bioavailability in the brain. In the current hypothesis, we propose surface modified nano-lipid drug conjugates (LDC-NPs) of PAMs of M-1 receptors to improve their bioavailability in brain. When co-administered with AChE inhibitors they are expected to increase their efficacy and reduce their therapeutic dose and side effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"An efficient and facile hydrothermal route for the pH-dictated synthesis of flower-like MoS2 photocatalyst was developed. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy characterization show the detailed morphologies of MoS2 microflowers. X-ray diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirm that the as-obtained product is of hexagonal MoS2 phase. The photocatalytic properties of flower-like MoS2 were evaluated by the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and methylene blue (MB) under natural sunlight irradiation. The synthetic pH value could dictate the MoS2 performance, where MS-1 (pH = 1) exhibited the best response amongst all the samples. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.
